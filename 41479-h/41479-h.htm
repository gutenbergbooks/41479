<h1>CURRENT HISTORY CHRONICLED</h1>

<p class="center small">[<span class="smcap">Period Ended May 19, 1918.</span>]</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Summary of War Activities</h3>

<p class="drop">Four weeks of comparative calm on the western front intervened after
the furious fighting that had continued throughout the preceding month.
The Germans made several desperate efforts to smash their way through
the British lines to the channel ports, but they failed. The British and
French lines stood firm as granite, and the enemy suffered frightful
losses. The battle lines remained practically unchanged.</p>

<p>From the English Channel to the Adriatic there was complete union of
the British, French, American, and Italian forces under a single
command; these forces, including reserves, were estimated at 6,000,000
men. No military event of importance occurred on the other fronts,
though the British made some further advances in Palestine and
Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>In political matters the month brought events of more importance,
chief of which was the renewal of an alliance between Germany and
Austria; this was accomplished at a meeting of the Emperors.</p>

<p>The acceleration of troop movements from the United States to France
was a feature of the month, the estimate for the four weeks running as
high as 150,000; it was semi-officially stated that in April, 1918, more
than 500,000 American soldiers were in France, and that by Jan. 1, 1919,
there would be 1,500,000 of our fighting men at the front, with 500,000
more at transportation, supply, and civil work; the speeding up of
shipbuilding and other war work was significant. The Third Liberty Loan
aggregated more than $4,000,000,000, with 17,000,000 subscribers,
proving a brilliant success. The President by proclamation extended
enemy alien restrictions to women also. A bill was passed enabling the
President to consolidate and co-ordinate executive bureaus, thus giving
him extraordinary executive powers. The sedition law was strengthened. A
new commercial agreement was made with Norway.</p>

<p>In Great Britain the chief event was the triumph of the Premier over
a military group that tried to overthrow his Ministry. There was a
recrudescence of the spirit of rebellion in Ireland. In France the
conviction of the Bonnet Rouge editors on a charge of treason deepened
confidence in the stability of the Government. The German penetration of
Russia continued, and all the evidence indicated that the country was
coming under Teutonic control, economically, industrially, and
financially. The humiliating peace forced on Rumania was ratified, and
the country passed practically under German and Austrian domination.</p>

<p>The month's record of enemy U-boat losses strengthened faith that
this menace was being eliminated and that new allied tonnage would
exceed losses in increasing ratio from May 1, 1918.</p>

<p>The chief naval event was the daring British raid on the German
submarine bases at Zeebrugge and Ostend; the channel at the first named
port was blocked, and the harbor entrance at Ostend, by means of a
second raid, was partially blocked, resulting in a serious hampering of
submarine operations. The Italians penetrated Pola Harbor, May 14, with
a small torpedo boat and sank a 20,000-ton Austrian dreadnought.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Sinn Fein Plot Frustrated</h3>

<p class="drop">During the night of May 18 the British authorities in Ireland
suddenly arrested at their homes about 500 of the leading Sinn Feiners
on the charge of having treasonable communication with the German enemy.
Among those arrested were the Sinn Fein members of Parliament, also the
conspicuous Irish agitators and irreconcilables, both men and women. A
proclamation was issued by the Lord Lieutenant declaring that a
conspiracy with Germany had been discovered, calling upon all loyal
Irishmen to assist in suppressing it, and urging voluntary enlistments.
It was believed that this prompt action had prevented a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_382" title="pg 382"> </a>
contemplated uprising, which was being aided by German spies.
Comparative calm followed the arrests.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Foch's Army Comprises All Races of Earth</h3>

<p class="drop">It seems certain that never in the world's history were so many
different races, peoples, and tongues united under the command of a
single man as are now gathered together in the army of Generalissimo
Foch. If we divide the human races into White, Yellow, Red, and Black,
all four are largely represented. Among the white races there are
Frenchmen, Italians, Portuguese, English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish,
Canadians, Australians, South Africans, (of both British and Dutch
descent,) New Zealanders; in the American Army, probably every other
European nation is represented, with additional contingents from those
already named, so that every branch of the white race figures in the
ethnological total. There are representatives of many Asiatic races,
including not only the volunteers from the native States of India, but
elements from the French colony in Cochin China, with Annam, Cambodia,
Tonkin, Laos, and Kwang Chau Wan. England and France both contribute
many African tribes, including Arabs from Algeria and Tunis, Senegalese,
Saharans, and many of the South African races. The red races of North
America are represented in the armies of both Canada and the United
States, while the Maoris, Samoans, and other Polynesian races are
likewise represented. And as, in the American Army, there are men of
German, Austrian, and Hungarian descent, and, in all probability,
contingents also of Bulgarian and Turkish blood, it may be said that
Foch commands an army representing the whole human race, united in
defense of the ideals of the Allies. The presence, among Foch's
strategic reserves, of 250,000 Italian soldiers is peculiarly
interesting, as no Italian force at all comparable to this in numbers
seems ever to have operated on French soil, though French armies have
again and again fought in Italy. During the early wars of Napoleon this
was the case, and again in 1859, when the battles of Magenta and
Solferino gave names to two new shades of red. In 1870 also there were
French troops in Rome; their withdrawal, in the Summer of that year,
opened the way for the final union of Italy.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Meeting of the German and Austrian Emperors</h3>

<p class="drop">The German and Austrian Emperors held a consultation at German Great
Headquarters on May 12 to discuss future relations between the two
empires. Emperor Karl was accompanied by Foreign Minister Burian, Field
Marshal von Arz, Chief of the General Staff, and Prince Hohenlohe,
Austrian Ambassador at Berlin. Germany was represented by Imperial
Chancellor von Hertling, Field Marshal von Hindenburg, General
Ludendorff, Foreign Secretary von Kuehlmann, and Count von Wedel,
Ambassador at Vienna.</p>

<p>According to an official statement issued in Berlin, all the
fundamental political, economic, and military questions affecting
present and future relations were thoroughly discussed, and "there was
complete accord on all these questions, tending to deepen the existing
alliance." In many quarters the impression prevailed that the result of
the meeting was to define and recognize formally the subservient
relations of Austria-Hungary toward the German Empire. The State
Department at Washington made public a report based upon indications
given by the Berlin newspapers that the agreement made at the meeting
concerned three points:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. The duration of the alliance was fixed for twenty-five years.</p>

<p>2. Germany and Austria-Hungary are to sign a military convention
imposing upon each much stricter military obligations than did the
preceding treaty.</p>

<p>3. The economic relations will be regulated so as to realize the plan
of Mitteleuropa.</p> </blockquote>

<p>A solution of the Polish question was also arrived at, according to a
newspaper statement published in Berlin, on the lines of complete union
between Austria-Hungary and Poland. Another message said that the German
and Austrian Emperors
<a class="pagenum" id="page_383" title="pg 383"></a>
had selected monarchs for Poland, Lithuania, Courland, and Esthonia. It
was officially stated that no actual treaty was signed.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting subsequent revelations was that King
Ludwig of Bavaria and King Frederick August of Saxony were also present
at the meeting at German Great Headquarters. Some of the reports
represented these two monarchs as having been present uninvited.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">The Prince Sixtus Letter</h3>

<p class="drop">Arthur J. Balfour, British Secretary of Foreign Affairs, replying to
inquiries in the House of Commons, May 16, stated that Emperor Karl's
peace letter to Prince Sixtus, which had been received while Mr. Balfour
was in America, was a private letter written by Emperor Charles
to a relative (Prince Sixtus of Bourbon) and conveyed by him to
President Poincar&eacute; and the French Premier under seal of the
strictest secrecy, but with no permission to communicate it to any one
except the Sovereign and Premier of this country, [Great Britain.] The
letter was communicated to the French and English Premiers under these
pledges.</p>

<p>He stated that he had no secrets from President Wilson, and added:
"Every thought I have on the war or on the diplomacy connected with the
war is as open to President Wilson as to any other human being." He
declared that he regarded the Sixtus letter as not a peace effort, but a
manoeuvre to divide the Allies. He declared that they were not fighting
for "a bigger Alsace-Lorraine than in 1870," and added:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If any representative of any belligerent country desires seriously to
lay before us any proposals we are ready to listen to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lord Robert Cecil, Minister of Blockade,
in the same debate, after indorsing
the preceding statement of Mr. Balfour,
added this reference to Russia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have no quarrel with Russia at all. On the contrary, with the
Russian people we have always desired to be on the closest possible
terms of friendship. We are anxious to do all we can to support and
assist the Russian people to preserve Russia as a great country, not
only now, but in the period after the war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lord Robert denied that Great Britain had any quarrel with the
Bolsheviki over their domestic policy, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is a matter for Russia, and Russia alone; we have no other
desire than to see Russia great, powerful, and non-German.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="smcap">Attacks on Hospital Ships</h3>

<p class="drop">The British Admiralty issued an official announcement on May 1,
stating that it was considered proved conclusively that the British
hospital ship Guildford Castle was attacked by a German submarine in
the Bristol Channel, March 10, and narrowly escaped destruction. At
the time the Guildford Castle was carrying 438 wounded soldiers and
flying a Red Cross flag of the largest size with distinguishing marks
distinctly illuminated. The attack occurred at 5:35 P. M., in clear
weather. Two torpedoes were fired. In evidence of attacks on hospital
ships the British Admiralty quotes the following extracts from the
German official message, sent through the German wireless stations on
April 24, 1918:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With respect to the results of the submarine war for the month of
march, the Deutsche Tageszeitung says: "Lloyd George and Geddes falsify
the losses of ships plying in the military service (? ignoring)
so-called naval losses, auxiliary cruisers, guard ships, <i>hospital
ships</i>, and very probably also troop transports and munition
steamers, that is to say, precisely that shipping space <i>which is
particularly exposed to and attacked by the U-boats</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="smcap">Two More Latin-American Republics Aligned
Against Germany</h3>

<p class="drop">On April 22, 1918, the National Assembly of Guatemala declared that
that republic occupied the same position toward the European
belligerents as did the United States. Guatemala had broken off
diplomatic relations with Germany in April, 1917. On May 7 Nicaragua
declared war against Germany and her allies. The declaration was in the
form of a recommendation of President Chamorro, which the Nicaraguan
Congress adopted with only four dissenting votes. A further declaration
was adopted of solidarity with the United States and the other American
republics at war with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_384" title="pg 384"> </a>
Germany and Austria-Hungary. Nicaragua was the twentieth nation to
declare war against Germany. Uruguay remains a neutral at this writing.
On April 12 the Government asked Berlin, through Switzerland, whether
Germany considered that a state of war existed with Uruguay, as stated
by the commander of a submarine who had captured a Uruguayan military
commission bound for France. The German Government replied on May 16
that it did not consider that a state of war existed. Chile refused to
ask free passage of Spain for a commission of Chileans who sought to
reach Germany, thereby indicating partiality to the Germans. Argentina
in the President's message, delivered May 18, 1918, reaffirmed its
neutrality.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">France's Second Treason Trial.</h3>

<p class="drop">Duval, who was director of the suppressed Germanophile newspaper,
Bonnet Rouge, was condemned to death May 15 by court-martial for
treason, and six other defendants were sentenced to imprisonment:
Marion, assistant manager, for ten years; Landau, a reporter, eight
years; Goldsky, a reporter, eight years; Joucla, a reporter, five years;
Vercasson, two years and $1,000 fine; Leymarie, former director of the
Ministry of the Interior, two years' imprisonment and $200 fine.</p>

<p>The Bonnet Rouge was an evening paper of decided pacifist tendency,
which lost no occasion of belittling the military and political leaders
and policy, not only of France, but also of England. The attention of
the Government was drawn to it early in 1917, and its editor, Almeyreda,
and its manager, Duval, were under lock and key by August, 1917.</p>

<p>The police investigations showed that the Bonnet Rouge was to a great
extent dependent for its capital upon men whose ardor in the allied
cause had not been notable, and revealed the astonishing fact that M.
Malvy, as Minister of the Interior, had thought fit to subsidize the
paper to the extent of $1,200 a month and to encourage it in other ways.
It also became known to the public that Almeyreda before the war had
been in the closest contact with M. Caillaux and that he had received
from that politician, at the moment when Mme. Caillaux was being tried
for the murder of M. Calmette, the editor of the Figaro, the sum of
$8,000.</p>

<p>Duval, whose journeys to Switzerland had aroused the misgivings of
the Government, was detained at the French frontier station, searched,
and found to be in possession of a check for $32,800 drawn to the order
of a Mannheim banking firm, the business relations of which will appear
in subsequent trials. This check was photographed and was handed back to
Duval by some one of the French military or civil secret service
officials.</p>

<p>Almeyreda had hardly reached prison when he fell seriously ill and
was removed to the infirmary prison at Fresnes. There he died. The
official doctors first of all declared that he had been strangled, and
then gave it as their opinion that he had committed suicide.</p>

<p>Louis J. Malvy, who was at the time Under Secretary of the Interior,
and was Minister of the Interior under Ribot, will be tried by a
parliamentary court on the charge of having been in personal relations
with Duval and of having delivered to the Germans the scheme of the
abruptly ended French offensive in the Champagne in April, 1917.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">The City of Amiens.</h3>

<p class="drop">Amiens, the old capital city of Picardy, goes far back into the
military history of Europe. Probably deriving its name from the Belgic
tribe of Ambiani, it was the centre of Julius Caesar's campaigns against
those warlike tribes. Several Roman Emperors had military headquarters
there, and it early gained importance as a bishopric. Evrard de
Fouilloy, the forty-fifth Bishop, began the great Gothic cathedral of
Amiens, one of the finest in the world, in the year 1220, the plans
being made by Ren&eacute; de Luzarches, while the work was completed by
Thomas de Cormont and his son Renault in the year 1288, though the two
great towers were not finished until a century later. Because it is
intersected by eleven canals Louis XI. called Amiens "the little
Venice."
<a class="pagenum" id="page_385" title="pg 385"> </a></p>

<p>Only second to the great cathedral in fame is the H&ocirc;tel de
Ville, built between 1660 and 1760, in which, on May 25, 1802, was
signed the famous treaty of Amiens, Napoleon's brother, Joseph
Bonaparte, being plenipotentiary for France. The parties to the Peace of
Amiens were France, England, Holland, and Spain. To Holland were
restored the Cape of Good Hope, Guiana, and other colonies; France
received Martinique and Guadeloupe; Spain received Minorca; Malta went
to the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem, while Egypt was restored to
Turkey. England was secured in the control of India, and received
Ceylon, (which had been first Portuguese and later Dutch,) and the
island of Trinidad. But many of these dispositions were greatly modified
thirteen years later, at the close of the Napoleonic wars.</p>

<p>In Amiens there is a famous Napoleonic Museum, which has many fine
paintings by Puvis de Chavannes, including "War," "Peace," "Work," and
"Rest." When, on Nov. 28, 1876, Amiens was captured by the army of the
Prussians all religious monuments, including the cathedral, were
scrupulously guarded against any possible damage, and the rights of
private property were respected. Another of the titles of Amiens to fame
is the fact that Peter the Hermit, leader of the First Crusade, was born
there in 1050.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">The Rumanian Nation</h3>

<p class="drop">Of the Emperor Hadrian's colony of Roman veterans at the mouth of the
Danube there remain many architectural monuments, including parts of two
fine bridges across the great river, a
largely Latin in substance, and the name Romania.
The Roman colony spread through the Carpathians along the Roman road
into Transylvania. It was in part submerged by Hun and Magyar waves of
invasion, and the western part of the Rumanian people, west of the
Carpathians, is still under Magyar rule, while a small number of
Rumanians inhabit the Austrian crownland of Bukowina, once Rumanian
soil. The Turks, following in the track of the Huns and Magyars, once
more swept over Rumania and on toward Vienna and Russia, completely
submerging the Balkan Peninsula, with the exception of the Black
Mountain, Montenegro, held by Serbs.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century the Balkan nations began to extricate
themselves: Greece, with the aid of France, England, and Russia; Serbia,
with the aid of Russia; and the two principalities of Wallachia and
Moldavia, which were later to become Rumania. In the wars of Catherine
the Great and Suvoroff, which Byron has embodied in his comedy epic,
making Don Juan take part in the siege of Ismail, Russia took from
Turkey the Province of Bessarabia, named from an old Rumanian princely
house and largely populated by Rumanians.</p>

<p>The western half of Bessarabia was taken back from Russia and
restored to Turkey after the Crimean War, immediately after which, in
1861, the two principalities were united in the single principality of
Rumania, under Colonel Cuza, a Rumanian, as Hospodar, or Lord, Turkish
suzerainty being acknowledged. In this way the strip of Bessarabia which
had been Russian for half a century became not Turkish, but Rumanian.
When Russia declared war against Turkey in 1877 she announced to Rumania
that she sought the restoration of her strip of Bessarabian land; and,
knowing this, Rumania became Russia's ally in the war against Turkey,
with Prince Carol as commander of her forces, he being of the Roman
Catholic branch of the Hohenzollerns. In 1881 he took the title of King,
to which his nephew Ferdinand succeeded in 1914.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">The Hetman of the Ukraine</h3>

<p class="drop">Writing in 1818, Byron described Mazeppa as "the Ukraine Hetman, calm
and bold," and it is to the period of Mazeppa and even earlier that this
title and office goes back. The word Hetman is of uncertain origin, but
is probably derived from the Bohemian Heitman, a modification of
Hauptmann or Headman. When the Ukraine, the "borderland," was under
Polish suzerainty, in the period from 1592 to 1654, the epoch of "Fire
and Sword," "Pan Michael," and "The Deluge," the Hetman
<a class="pagenum" id="page_386" title="pg 386"> </a>
of the Cossacks, (a Tartar word,
kazak, meaning warrior,) was a semi-independent
viceroy.</p>

<p>After the acceptance of Russian suzerainty
by the Ukraine under the great
Hetman, Khmelnitski, in 1654, the title
and authority of the Hetman were at
first continued, but his power and privileges
were gradually curtailed and
finally abolished. It is not certain
whether the word Ataman is a modification
of Hetman or a Tartar title; at any
rate, we find the title, "Ataman of all
the Cossacks," coming into use as an
appanage of the Czarevitch, or heir
apparent of Russia, somewhat as the
title of Prince of Wales is an appanage
of the heir apparent of England. The
Czarevitch was represented by Hetmans
by delegation, for each division of the
Cossacks, these divisions being military
colonies westward as far as the Caspian,
like that described by Tolstoy in his
novel, "The Cossacks."</p>

<p>Writing in 1799, W. Tooke, in his
"View of the Russian Empire," described
the insignia of the Hetman as
being the truncheon, the national standard,
the horsetail, kettledrums and signet,
a group of emblems strongly suggesting
Tartar influence; the dress of
the Cossacks was, likewise, borrowed
from that of the Caucasus Mohammedan
tribes, and in this Caucasian dress the
new Hetman of the Ukraine, Skoropadski,
took office at Kiev. His name indicates
that he is not a Ruthenian, (Little
Russian,) but a Pole. It has been a consistent
element of Austrian policy to
favor the Poles at the expense of the
Ruthenians, with the result that many
Poles are strongly pro-Austrian, and
hold high office under the Austrian
crown.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Precedents for a Separate Ulster.</h3>

<p class="drop">When the Dominion of Canada was
formed by the British North America
act of 1867, it included only four
provinces, Upper and Lower Canada,
(Ontario and Quebec,) Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick. Provision was made
in the act for the voluntary admission
of Prince Edward's Island, the Northwest
Territories and Newfoundland into
the Dominion. While the Northwest
Territories took advantage of this provision,
and are now organized as the
Provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia,
Alberta, Saskatchewan, Yukon and
the Northwest Territories, Newfoundland,
with Labrador, the latter 120,000
square miles in area, preferred to remain
outside the Dominion of Canada,
and has a wholly distinct Constitution
and administration, as independent of
Canada as is that, for example, of British
Guiana. Compulsion was never suggested
to bring Newfoundland and Labrador
within the Dominion of Canada,
though Labrador is geographically a
part of the Canadian mainland.</p>

<p>In Australia likewise the union of the
colonies was entirely voluntary. Five
of these, New South Wales, Victoria,
Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania,
by legislative enactments, approved
by the direct vote of the electors,
declared their desire for a federal union,
and the Imperial Parliament gave effect
to this by the act of July 9, 1900. This
act provided for the inclusion of Western
Australia in the Australian Commonwealth,
if that colony so desired;
and Western Australia shortly expressed
and carried out that desire.</p>

<p>The population of Ulster in 1911 was
1,581,696, (that of Belfast being 386,947;)
the population of Newfoundland
with Labrador in 1914 was 251,726; the
population of Western Australia when it
exercised the option of inclusion in the
Commonwealth of Australia was 184,114;
it has since nearly doubled. A
similar case of separate treatment, this
time within the United States, is that of
West Virginia, which, in 1862, determined
to remain within the Union when
the rest of Virginia seceded. West Virginia
became a State on Dec. 31, 1862,
and was not re-integrated in the Old
Dominion at the close of the civil war.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Court-Martial in Italy.</h3>

<p class="drop">Four principal Directors of the Genoese
Electrical Power Company,
named K&ouml;nigsheim, Ampt, Martelli, and
Hess, early in April were sentenced to
death by court-martial at Milan by being
"shot in the spine," and a decoy girl
<a class="pagenum" id="page_387" title="pg 387"> </a>
was doomed to twenty years' imprisonment,
while three associates were relegated
to the galleys for life. It was
proved that the condemned men received
from Germany wireless messages, to be
forwarded to North and South America
for the purposes of its underseas campaign,
and incriminating letters of their
treasonable acts were discovered. Ampt
and his three co-Directors received a
decoration from the Imperial Government,
but were so successful in deceiving
the Italian Government that they were
subsequently decorated as Cavalieres of
the Crown of Italy.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">American Trade Pact with Norway.</h3>

<p class="drop">The signing of a general commercial
agreement between the United
States and Norway--the first agreement
of the kind to be entered into by America
with one of the North European neutrals--was
announced by the War Trade
Board on May 3, 1918. It was signed by
Vance McCormick, Chairman of the War
Trade Board, and Dr. Fridtjof Nansen,
the famous explorer, who was sent to the
United States at the head of a special
mission.</p>

<p>Under the agreement Norway is
assured of supplies to cover her estimated
needs so far as they can be furnished
without detriment to the war needs of the
United States and its allies, and Norway,
on her part, agrees to permit the exportation
to America and its allies of all Norwegian
products not needed for home
consumption. It is provided that none
of the supplies imported from the United
States or its allies or forwarded with the
aid of American bunker coal shall go
directly or indirectly to the Central Powers
or be used to replace commodities
exported to those countries. This applies
to anything produced by any auxiliaries
to production obtained under the agreement.
In consequence of the agreement
the War Trade Board announced on May
9 that exports to Norway were about to
be resumed.</p>

<p>Another result of the improved relations
between the two countries was the
chartering by the United States Shipping
Board of 400,000 tons of Norwegian sailing
ships, to be put in non-hazardous
trades, thereby releasing other ships for
traffic in the danger zones. This was
one of the most substantial increases
which the American-controlled merchant
fleet has received since its inception.</p>

Hatred Between Italians and Austrians</h3>

<p class="drop">The implacable hatred which has developed between Italians and
Austrians is illustrated by the following Italian
<i>communiqu&eacute;</i>, issued in Rome on Feb. 11, in reply to the
Austrian Supreme Command's denial that the Austro-Germans were first to
bombard cities from airplanes. It points out that the Austro-Germans
first bombarded Udine, Treviso, Padua, Verona, Venice, Ravenna, &amp;c.,
massacring defenseless and innocent populations and ruining valuable art
treasures, and adds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Italians went to Trieste not to bombard citizens and private
houses, but the hydroplane stations in which are sheltered the assassins
of Venice, and the two vessels of the Monarch type which were kept by
the Imperial and Royal Navy behind the dyke, in the hope that the
Italian elements of the city would help to protect them and afterward
enable them to set out on some heroic enterprise against the defenseless
localities on the Adriatic Coast. Immediately the hydroplanes, yielding
to the indignation of the whole world, ceased bombarding Venice, and
immediately the two vessels of the Monarch type were removed from
Trieste, our aerial raids ceased, since an understanding was
proposed.</p>

<p>We wage war against the enemy's armed forces, and not against women,
children, monuments, and hospitals. In spite of the most solemn denial
issued by the Austrians of the acts which, after the first bombardments
of Padua, Treviso, and Vicenza at the end of December and the beginning
of January, they declared to be a question of reprisals for
bombardments, carried out by Franco-British aviators on German towns,
the Germans, in substance, gave to be understood what the Austrians
hypocritically wished to hide, that is, that the pretext of reprisals
enabled them to persevere with their nameless atrocities, which had been
imposed upon them by some of their leaders having yielded to the
impulses of a criminal mentality. Thus it happened that the Austrian
Catholic command, bowing to the orders of the German Lutheran pastors,
bombarded Catholic churches in the Italian cities. And so we see the
Austro-Hungarian Government&mdash;so solicitous for peace and love
between nations&mdash;sowing hatred which nothing can quench.</p>

The Origin of the Irish</h3>

<p class="drop">Perhaps some light may be shed on the internal divisions which make
the solution of the Irish question so nearly impossible by a realization
of the fact that the population of Ireland consists of an unassimilated
congeries of races, every element of which except one represents foreign
invasion and conquest.</p>

<p>The earliest race, short, round-headed, dark, appears to be akin to
the Ligurian race of the Mediterranean; this race hunted the huge Irish
elks with flint arrows and axes, and may claim to be the real indigenous
stock, still surviving in the west. The second race, tall, dark,
long-headed, was akin to the Iberians (Basques) of Spain, who also
invaded Western France, and who probably built the cromlechs and stone
circles, since these are also found in Iberian Spain and Western France,
as at Carnac in Brittany. The third race, tall, golden-haired,
blue-eyed, came from the Baltic, bringing amber beads, and building
chambered pyramids, such as are also found in Denmark. The fourth race
to arrive included the Gaels, tall, round-headed, with red hair and gray
eyes; they came from Central Europe, probably by way of France.</p>

<p>Each new arrival was followed by wars of conquest, the Gaels finally
making themselves predominant, but not exterminating the older races,
examples of whom may still be found, with unchanged race
characteristics. In 1169 Norman French and Welsh came, as mercenaries in
the army of the King of Leinster. The Burkes are descended from the
Normans, the Fitzgeralds from the Welsh.</p>

<h2>Battles in Picardy and Flanders</h2>

<h3>Military Review of All Fronts from April 17 to May 18, 1918.</h3>

<p class="drop">In order to obtain a view of the situation of the German offensive on
April 17, which forms a background for the events to be related in this
review, it is necessary to point out a few controlling facts and
conditions&mdash;some long obvious, some recently revealed.</p>

<p>Ludendorff's major plan, based on the assumed shortness of vision on
the part of the Allies, to separate the British from the French and, by
isolating the former in the north and driving the latter toward their
bases in the south, thereby reach the mouth of the Somme, had failed. It
had failed, just as did the plan of Napoleon at Charleroi in 1815 to
separate the English from the Prussians. It failed because the military
genius of the British General Carey and the French General Fayolle on
two separate occasions had closed up gaps in the line of the Allies, and
because the vast masses of German troops were incapable, on account of
their demoralization, of making the fractures permanent.</p>

<p>It is now evident that the demoralization of General Gough's 5th
Army, which began on March 23, not only threatened his junction with
Byng's 3d Army, by forming an eight-mile gap between the two&mdash;into
which, as has already been related, Carey moved his hastily gathered
nondescript detachment&mdash;but as the 5th Army retreated another gap,
gradually lengthening to nearly thirty miles, was opened between its
right wing and the 6th French Army. Here General Fayolle, who had just
appeared on the field from Italy, did with organized divisions what
Carey had done with his scratch volunteers further north.</p>

<p class="center">DIAGRAM SHOWING 8-MILE GAP, MARCH 23, WHICH WAS FILLED BY CAREY'S "SCRATCH DIVISION," WHO HELD THE BREACH FOR SIX DAYS</p>
</div>

<p>From statements made before the Reichstag Main Committee, but more
especially from letters and diaries found on captured German officers,
it appears that both Carey and Fayolle stopped an armed mob, utterly
incapable of taking advantage of the situation it had created as a
disciplined force. Regiments thrown together, officers separated from
their commands, detachments without control, all due to the impetuous
rush forward, could not recover in time to prevent Carey and Fayolle
from completing their work.</p>

<p>But Ludendorff's major plan, having failed in the first month of his
offensive, could not be repeated in the second. Since April 30 there has
been no French, British, Belgian, Portuguese, or American front in
Flanders or Picardy&mdash;only the front of the Allies, with the troops
of their several nations used wherever needed by the supreme commander,
Foch.</p>

<p>During the first month of the offensive two angles had been developed
by Ludendorff: The first, the great one, in the south, from a base of
sixty miles with a forty-mile perpendicular and its vertex near the
Somme; the second in the north, from a base of twenty miles
<a class="pagenum" id="page_390" title="pg 390"> </a>
with a fifteen-mile perpendicular and its vertex on the edge of the
Forest of Nieppe. Between these two angles the original front of Lens,
from Bailleul north to Givenchy, still held, fifteen miles in length.
There had been voluntary or forced changes made by the Allies east of
Ypres and east of Arras.</p>

</div>

<p>The corollary in Flanders, unless it
could be demonstrated, would be as great
a failure as the main proposition in
Picardy. And the still possible successful
issue of the latter depended absolutely,
as we shall see, on a complete
demonstration of the former. Both
have been so far handicapped by the
augmenting mobility of the Allies, their
growing numbers, their centralized command,
and their successful insistence to
control the air.</p>

<p>Such was the situation in Flanders and
Picardy which confronted Ludendorff at
the dawn of the second month of the
German offensive. The whole problem
to be solved was just as apparent to the
Allies as it was to him&mdash;to gain the barriers
which threatened his angles of
penetration, in order again to utilize his
preponderant forces of men and guns on
a broad front. To attempt to extend the
vertices without broadening the sides
would mean to court danger, even destruction,
at their weakest points.</p>

<p>His frontal attacks upon Ypres and
Arras, respectively from the Passchendaele
Ridge and against the Vimy Ridge,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_391" title="pg 391"> </a>
having failed, it became necessary to attempt
to flank the Allies by the occupation
of their defensive ridges. This explains
his successful assaults upon Mont
Kemmel, 325 feet high, and his desire
to envelop Mont Rouge, 423 feet high,
and his persistent attacks along the La
Bass&eacute;e Canal against the heights of
B&eacute;thune, 141 feet, all preceded by diversions
between the Somme and Avre, with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_392" title="pg 392"> </a>
concentrations at Villers-Bretonneux,
Hangard, and elsewhere.</p>

</div>

<p>On April 18 the French made a feint
on both banks of the Avre River south
of Hangard, drove in a mile, and picked
up some prisoners; simultaneously the
Germans, with a force of 137,000, made
a heavy assault upon the allied front lying
across the La Bass&eacute;e Canal, with a diversion
on the Lys River near St. Venant.</p>

<p class="center">
SCENE OF THE MONTH'S HEAVIEST FIGHTING IN FLANDERS, ESPECIALLY ABOUT MOUNT KEMMEL</p>
</div>

<hr />

<p>Before the day was done they had
switched their attack to the Kemmel sector.
In all three places the Germans
suffered repulse, with the loss of a few
hundred prisoners. Four days later the
British advanced their lines on the Lys,
just as the French had on the Avre.
Then on the 24th came the great enemy
diversion at Villers-Bretonneux, nine
miles southeast of Amiens. Here the
Germans used tanks for the first time.
The village, lost to the British on the
first day, was recovered on the second,
when just to the south the French and
American troops were hotly contesting
with the Germans the possession of Hangard.
The sharp salient at this place
made it difficult for the Allies to hold,
while its retention, except as a site from
which losses could be inflicted on the
Germans, was unnecessary. Consequently
it was evacuated, after the attacking
detachment of the Prussian Guards had
been annihilated.</p>

<h3>BATTLE FOR MONT KEMMEL</h3>

<p>Meanwhile the Germans had been preparing
for a decisive assault against
Mont Kemmel with ever-augmenting
artillery fire and with the concentration
of vast numbers of troops on the sidings
of the railroad between the villages of
Messines and Wytschaete. These troops
numbered nine divisions, or about 120,000
men. From the 24th till the 27th they
incessantly swung around Mont Kemmel
in massed front and flank attacks, until
the French and British were forced to
give up the height, together with the
village of the same name and the village
of Dranoutre, retiring on La Clytte and
Scherpenberg.</p>

<p>The occupation of Mont Kemmel, however,
did not, as Ludendorff had anticipated,
force the British out of the Ypres
salient, for their voluntary retirement
from part of the Passchendaele Ridge on
April 17-19 had strengthened the salient,
which could hold as long as the line of
hills west of Kemmel held&mdash;Mont
Rouge, Mont Diviagne, Mont des
Cats, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%">

<p class="center">
REGION OF HANGARD AND VILLERS-BRETONNEUX, WHERE GERMANS USED TANKS FOR THE FIRST TIME</p>
</div>

<p>The Berlin publicity bureau advertised the fact that a direct thrust
at Ypres had brought the Germans to within three miles of the
town&mdash;an achievement of no particular military value&mdash;while it
quite ignored the capture of Mont Kemmel, for the simple reason that its
value <a class="pagenum" id="page_393" title="pg 393"> </a> was now
discovered to repose in their ability to carry their occupation
throughout the entire range.</p>

<p>This they have since been vainly, except for local advances, trying
to do, often employing great forces of men in mass for two or three days
at a time&mdash;striving vainly to broaden the salient in three places:
between Dickebusch and Voormezeele, due south from Ypres; by an
envelopment of Mont Rouge to the southwest; on the south by an advance
in the direction of B&eacute;thune.</p>

<h3>VON ARNIM'S EFFORTS</h3>

<p>In the northern part of the salient the attacks reached their climax
on Monday, April 29, when General Sixt von Arnim's army was hurled in
wave after wave between Voormezeele and Scherpenberg and on the latter
and Mont Rouge, only to end in a repulse, which, on account of the
number of men believed to have been lost by the enemy, may be considered
a disastrous defeat. All this time a heavy bombardment had been going on
in the B&eacute;thune region in preparation for an infantry attack
there; yet on account of the defeat further north, it could not be
delivered.</p>

<p>Henceforth, until May 16, von Arnim was obviously placed on the
defensive, whereas the Allies were locally on the offensive, either
recovering lost strategic points or consolidating their lines. On May 5,
between Locre and Dranoutre, the Franco-British forces advanced on a
1,000-yard front to the depth of 500 yards. On the 8th the Germans made
a half-hearted attack on the sector south of Dickebusch Lake and entered
British trenches, only to be repulsed with heavy loss. A similar attack
the next day between La Clytte and Voormezeele not only met with a
similar repulse, but was followed up by a strong British counterattack
which won considerable ground. On the 12th the French captured Hill 44
on the north flank of Kemmel, between La Clytte and Vierstraat.</p>

<p>On May 13 renewed enemy artillery activity on the lines back of
B&eacute;thune seemed to presage that an infantry attack was intended
there. Nothing of this nature ensued, however. On the 15th the Germans
made a sudden attack against Hill 44 but were hurled back by the French.
On the 16th-17th they maintained a concentrated fire north of
Kemmel.</p>

<h3>GERMAN ATTACKS ON THE LYS</h3>

<p>All these operations on the German northern salient, which is
gradually coming to be called the Lys salient, have shown no indication
of being intended to pave the way for a renewal of the general offensive
in Flanders. Their success might, and probably would, have forced the
evacuation of Ypres and affected the Picardy salient with its vertex
near Amiens, forcing the evacuation of Arras. But, as we have seen, the
operations on the Lys salient, meeting with an overwhelming obstruction
on April 29, did not achieve these results. Throughout the next three
weeks the manoeuvres of the enemy in Picardy afforded excellent
opportunities for counterattacks on the part of the Allies, whose object
here has been to punish the enemy as much as possible and to consolidate
every strategic position on a broad front in anticipation of a renewal
of Germany's original scheme to isolate the allied armies north of the
Somme by a dash to the mouth of that river via Amiens.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, the enemy on April 30 launched heavy attacks
on the French lines in the region of Hangard and Noyon. These fell down,
and on May 2 the French made distinct gains in Hangard Wood and near
Mailly-Raineval. The next day the French advanced
<a class="pagenum" id="page_394" title="pg 394"> </a>
their lines between Hailles and Castel, south of the Avre, and captured
Hill 82. On the 6th the British advanced their lines between the Somme
and the Ancre, southwest of Morlancourt, and in the neighborhood of
Locon and the Lawe River, taking prisoners in both places. On the 11th
skirmishes southwest of Mailly-Raineval, between Hangard and Montdidier,
developed into a pitched battle, in which the French at first lost
ground and then recovered it. On May 14 the Germans, after an intense
local bombardment, delivered a spirited attack on a mile front of the
British southwest of Morlancourt, gaining a footing in their first
trenches. Instantly some Australian troops counterattacked and
completely re-established the British positions. On the 16th and 17th
the enemy showed impressive and portentous artillery activity along the
Avre and at Rollott, on the Abb&eacute;ville road, south of Montdidier,
similar in character to that observed north of Kemmel, on the Lys
salient.</p>

<p>There are now believed to be over half a million American rifles on
the western front, either at definite places or available as reserves.
On April 20 a battalion of Germans made a raid on our eight-mile sector
south of the Woeuvre, and succeeded in reaching the front-line trenches
and taking the village of Seicheprey. Our losses were between 200 and
300; 300 German dead were counted. A detachment of our army, principally
artillery, holds a sector of five miles with the French infantry east of
Montdidier, on the Picardy front, protecting the Beauvais-Amiens road.
Here their fire is principally employed in breaking up German
concentrations and transport in and around Montdidier.</p>

<h3>THE ZEEBRUGGE RAID</h3>

<p>The German submarine bases at Zeebrugge and Ostend on the Belgian
coast have been repeatedly bombed from the sea and shelled by British
monitors with indifferent results. With the adding of super-U-boats to
the German submarine fleet and the increased transatlantic traffic of
the Allies the necessity for effectually sealing these bases has long
been apparent. Theoretically the nature of the entrance to the harbors
of both places, resembling the neck of a bottle, about 250 feet wide,
made such a task easy by the sinking of block ships. Practically it was
most difficult, on account of both sea obstructions and the shore
batteries.</p>

<p>On the night of April 22-23 British naval forces, commanded by Vice
Admiral Keyes, with the co-operation of French destroyers, and hidden by
a newly devised smoke-screen, invented and here employed by
Wing-Commander Brock, attempted to seal up the harbors. At Zeebrugge the
enterprise was entirely successful. The Intrepid and Iphigenia were sunk
well within and across the narrow channel, the Thetis at the entrance.
All three were loaded with cement, which became solid concrete after
contact with the water and can be removed only by submarine blasting. A
detachment of troops was also landed on the mole from the Vindictive and
engaged the crews of the German machine gun batteries stationed there.
An old submarine was placed under the bridge of the mole and detonated.
A German destroyer and some small craft were sunk. Before the blockships
were placed a torpedo had been driven against the lock gates which lead
from the channel into the inner harbors. The expedition retired with the
loss of fifty officers and 538 men, of whom sixteen officers and 144 men
had been killed.</p>

<p>At Ostend, the entrance to whose harbor is protected by no mole, the
block ships Sirius and Brilliant were not effectively placed. Against
this port the experiment was, therefore, repeated on the night of May
9-10. The Vindictive, with a cargo of concrete, was planted and sunk at
the entrance to the channel, but not entirely blocking it.</p>

<h3>ITALIAN RAID AT POLA</h3>

<p>Another naval exploit of the month worthy of record was the sinking
in the Austrian Harbor of Pola of a dreadnought of the Viribus Unitis
class (20,000 tons) by Italian naval forces, in the morning of May 15.
The achievement was similar to that performed by the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_395" title="pg 395"> </a>
Italians on the night of Dec. 9-10, when a destroyer sawed her way
through the steel net protecting the Harbor of Trieste and torpedoed the
predreadnoughts Wien and Monarch, (5,000 tons each,) sinking the former.
The Harbor of Pola, however, is much more difficult to penetrate. It is
three miles deep and entered by a two-mile channel, at certain places
less than half a mile wide, and protected along its entire course by
strong defenses. A mole covers its mouth, making the channel here less
than 1,000 yards wide. Forts Cristo and Musil guard the entrance.</p>

<h3>TEUTONIZING THE BLACK SEA</h3>

<p>Save for the reports which have come to hand denoting the steady
progress of the British forces in Palestine and Mesopotamia, little of
importance has occurred in the Near East. Still the Teutonizing of the
Black Sea goes steadily on. On May 2 it was announced that a German
force had occupied the great Russian fortress of Sebastopol, famous for
its protracted siege by the British and French in 1855, and until then
considered impregnable. On May 12 part of the Russian Black Sea fleet
was taken possession of by the Germans at that place, while the
remainder escaped to Novorossysk. Among the captured vessels only the
battleship Volga and the protected cruiser Pamiat Merkuria were in
serviceable condition. At Odessa a new dreadnought and two protected
cruisers had already been seized by the Germans as they lay in their
slips.</p>

<p>In Macedonia the huge allied forces under the French General,
Guillaumat, are still waiting on events. The Greek Army is still in
process of reconstruction under the Venizelos Administration. The month,
however, has not been barren of engagements on this battleline. On April
28 the Serbians beat back attempts of the Bulgars to capture fortified
positions in the Vetrenik region; the French and British did the same in
regard to German attacks aimed at points west of Makovo and south of
Lake Doiran. So it has been all the month, the monotony only varied on
April 27, when there was intense artillery fire by the allied guns in
the neighborhood of Monastir, on the Cerna, and, in the Vetrenik region,
a Serbian assault annihilated a Bulgar section.</p>

<h3>IN THE NEAR EAST</h3>

<p>There has been no serious attempt on the part of the Turks during the
month to oppose the expansion of General Allenby's front beyond
Jerusalem or the triumphant march of General Marshall up the Euphrates
and the Tigris&mdash;on the latter river now sixty miles below Mosul,
Marshall's obvious objective. The objective of Allenby is Aleppo, where
there is said to be a single division of German
<a class="pagenum" id="page_396" title="pg 396"> </a>
troops in addition to the Turks, who have been forced north from
Jerusalem. Allenby and Marshall are advancing along parallel lines with
a desert space of about 400 miles between. The Turks and their ally
still have possession of the caravan trail and the partly built and
entirely surveyed Bagdad Railway, which intersect the prospective
parallel paths of Allenby and Marshall, whose lines of communication
already reach hundreds of miles to the rear. But while Allenby has a
lateral sea communication with Syrian ports, no such advantage is
enjoyed by Marshall, who must get all his supplies from the head of the
Persian Gulf, 450 miles to the south. Whatever be the force at the
disposition of the enemy, it is evident that he will continue to possess
a predominating tactical and strategic advantage until he has been
decisively defeated at both Aleppo and Mosul or a junction has been
established between Allenby and Marshall, or both.</p>

<p>The former's line, which is a sixty-mile front, extending from Arsuf
el Haram on the Mediterranean east to the Jordan, took Es-Salt with
thirty-three German and 317 Turkish prisoners on May 1&mdash;twenty
miles north of Jerusalem&mdash;which was first occupied by Allenby early
in December.</p>

<p>Marshall's advance has been much more rapid. In the week of May 1 his
cavalry, in pursuit of the fleeing Turks, advanced twenty miles and
captured 1,000 prisoners. On May 7 he was 80 miles from Mosul; on May 10
he was within 60 miles. Allenby is 300 miles from Aleppo and 110 miles
from Damascus.</p>

<h3>ON THE ITALIAN FRONT</h3>

<p>Without any large movements of troops taking place, several things
have occurred since April 18 to invite attention to the Italian front,
and much speculation by military men has been indulged in as to whether
the resumption of the Teutonic offensive would be from the Piave or
south from the Astico-Piave line lying across the Sette Comuni and the
Brenta, or from the west of the Adige and the Lago di Garda, in an
attempt to reach Brescia and the metallurgic centre of Italy.</p>

<p>And most of the things in question which have occurred have served to
restore and augment the confidence of the Italians in their position. A
new 2d Army has taken the place of the old, annihilated in the
Capporetto campaign. All the lost guns have been replaced and new
heavies added. Revolution is, at any moment, expected to break out in
Austria-Hungary, while the Congress of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_397" title="pg 397"> </a>
Jugoslavs in Rome on April 9-11 has secured the adhesion to the Allies
of the subjects of the Hapsburgs and enabled the Italian Government to
make use of them as a fighting force. There are now believed to be no
German divisions on the Italian front, where the entire enemy strength,
not measurably increased since the snows have disappeared in the north,
consists of 800 Austro-Hungarian battalions, or less than 1,000,000
men.</p>

<p>But what has promoted most satisfaction in the Italian Government and
people was the decree issued by the Interallied Supreme Council of War
at Abb&eacute;ville on May 3, giving General Foch authority to include
the Italian front under his supreme command, that front thereby becoming
the right wing of the allied battle line in Europe&mdash;now "one army,
one front, and one supreme command."</p>

<p>That is the way Bonaparte fought his victorious battles in the days
of the First Republic, alternately on the Rhine and the Adige. Moreau
could not win without Bonaparte, nor Bonaparte without Moreau, while
Carnot, in the centre, was the vehicle of transit.</p>

<p>Before the snows made manoeuvres impossible the Italians had closed
two gates which threatened the plains of Veneto from the north&mdash;one
at the junction of the front with the Piave, one at the angle of the
Frenzela Torrent and the Brenta River.</p>

<p>Gunfire had been steadily augmenting on the front when, on May 10,
they closed another, and on May 15 still another. The first of these was
the capture of Monte Corno, which commanded the part up the Vallarsa,
the second was a partial recovery of Monte Asolone, between the Brenta
and the Piave, sufficient to cover the path up the Val San Lorenzo. Both
mountains are really plateaus of about two square miles area each, whose
irregular summits the enemy had strongly fortified in order to clear the
valleys below. In both places subsequent Austrian counterattacks were
broken up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Italian aircraft dominate from above. On May 14 the enemy
lost eleven airplanes with no losses to the Italians and the British,
who were assisting them.</p>

<h3>Premier Lloyd George on German Autocracy</h3>

<p>Premier Lloyd George wrote the following preface for a volume containing
extracts from speeches he delivered during the war:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have never believed that the war would be a short war, or that in
some mysterious way, by negotiation or compromise, we would free Europe
from the malignant military autocracy which is endeavoring to trample it
into submission and moral death. I have always believed that the machine
which has established its despotic control over the minds and the bodies
of its victims and then organized and driven them to slaughter in order
to extend that control over the rest of the world, would only be
destroyed if the free peoples proved themselves strong and steadfast
enough to defeat its attempt in arms. The events of the last few weeks
must have made it plain to every thinking man that there is no longer
room for compromise between the ideals for which we and our enemies
stood. Democracy and autocracy have come to death grips. One or the
other will fasten its hold on mankind. It is a clear realization of this
issue which will be our strength in the trials to come. I have no doubt
that freedom will triumph. But whether it will triumph soon or late,
after a final supreme effort in the next few months or a long-drawn
agony, depends on the vigor and self-sacrifice with which the children
of liberty, and especially those behind the lines, dedicate themselves
to the struggle. There is no time for ease or delay or debate. The call
is imperative. The choice is clear. It is for each free citizen to do
his part.</p>

<h2>The Greatest Battle of the War</h2>

<h3>Second Month of the Desperate Fighting in Flanders and Picardy</h3>

<h3>By Philip Gibbs</h3>

<p class="center small"><i>Special Correspondent With the British
Armies</i> [Copyrighted in United States of America]</p>

<p><i>The May issue of Current History Magazine contained Philip Gibbs's
story of the great German offensive up to April 18, 1918. At that time
the Germans were seeking to break the British lines in front of Ypres,
as part of their drive for Amiens and the British Channel ports,
generally known as the battle of Picardy. The pages here presented are a
continuation of his eyewitness narrative of the most sanguinary battle
in history.</i></p>

<p class="drop">April 18.&mdash;The arrival of French troops on our northern front is
the most important act that has happened during the last three or four
days, and it was with deep satisfaction that we met these troops on the
roads and knew that at last our poor, tired men would get support and
help against their overwhelming odds.</p>

<p>Beside the khaki army of the British has grown very quickly an army
in blue, the cornflower blue of the French poilus. They are splendid
men, hard and solid fellows, who have been war-worn and weather-worn
during these three and a half years past, and look the great fighting
men who have gone many times into battle and know all that war can teach
them in endurance and cunning and quick attack.</p>

<p>As they came marching up the roads to the front they were like a
streaming river of blue&mdash;blue helmets and coats and blue carts and
blue lorries, all blending into one tone through these April mists as
they went winding over the countryside and through French market towns,
where their own people waved to them, and then through the villages on
the edge of the Flanders battlefields, where they waited to go into
action under shell-broken walls or under hedges above which British
shellfire traveled, or in fields where they made their bivouacs, and
fragrant steams arose to one's nostrils as cuistots lifted the lids of
stewpans and hungry men gathered around after a long march.</p>

<p>The attack this morning from Robecq, below St. Venant, down to
Givenchy, is a serious effort to gain La Bass&eacute;e Canal and form a
strong defensive flank for the enemy while he proceeds with his battles
further north and also to get more elbow room from the salient in which
he is narrowly wedged below Merville.</p>

<p>For this purpose he brought up several more divisions, including the
239th, which was in the Somme fighting of March, but not heavily
engaged. This one attacked the British at Robecq and was repulsed with
heavy losses. It was at a place called La Bacquerolles Farm, near
Robecq, where after heavy shelling last night the enemy rushed one of
the outposts at 10 o'clock. In order to facilitate the attack this
morning of German divisions north and south at 4 o'clock the German guns
began a heavy bombardment of the British lines as far down as Givenchy
and maintained it for five hours, using large numbers of gas shells, on
account of the east wind, which was in their favor.</p>

<p>His guns shelled the bridges across the canal in the hope of
preventing the British supports going up. Then his troops <a
class="pagenum" id="page_399" title="pg 399"> </a> came forward in waves
on a wide front. They were in immense numbers as usual, with many mixed
battalions. One of the British units today took prisoners from ten
different regiments. There were some ten German divisions facing four
British ones north of B&eacute;thune, and all along the line the troops
were much outnumbered; nevertheless, the enemy was repulsed at all but a
few points of attack and beaten back bloodily.</p>

<h3>THE GHASTLY LOSSES</h3>

<p>In this battle one regiment of the 42d German Division has lost over
50 per cent. of its strength, and other losses are on a similar scale.
These ghastly casualties have been piling up along this line between
Merville and B&eacute;thune since the 13th of this month, when the
Germans made a series of small attacks as a prelude to today's battle,
owing, it seems, to battalion officers taking the initiative without
orders from the High Command, in order to push forward and break the
British lines if they could find weakness there.</p>

<p>On the 13th and 14th some of the South Country troops were attacked
by strong forces repeatedly, and on the second day for five hours at a
stretch the enemy endeavored to come across from houses and inclosures
west of Merville toward St. Venant. For those five hours the South
Country lads fired with rifles, Lewis guns, and machine guns into solid
bodies of Germans, and their field guns tore gaps in the enemy's
formations and broke up their assemblies before the attacks could
proceed. One advance in five waves was mown down before it could make
any progress, and others were dealt with in the same way.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Gibbs describes the German repulse between Robecq and Givenchy
as a "black day for the enemy," and continues:</i></p>

<p>April 19.&mdash;At the end of the day all the enemy's efforts ended
in bloody failure, in spite of the daring and courage of his troops, who
sacrificed themselves under the British fire, but were only able to gain
a few bits of trench work and one or two outposts below the fortified
works at Givenchy, which are quite useless to them for immediate or
future use.</p>

<p>It was a big attack, for which they had prepared in a formidable way.
After the shock of their repulse by the Lancashire men of the 55th
Division they increased their strength of heavy artillery by three times
bringing up large numbers of howitzers, including eleven-inch monsters.
They were massed in divisions in front of us and determined to smash
through in the wake of a tremendous bombardment.</p>

<h3>BRITISH UNDER FIRE</h3>

<p>For five hours, as I said, this storm went on with high explosives
and gas, and the devoted British had to suffer this infernal thing, the
worst ordeal human beings may be called upon to bear, this standing to
while all the earth upheaved and the air was thick with shell
splinters.</p>

<p>But when the bombardment had passed and the German infantry came
forward the British received them with blasts of machine-gun fire,
incessant volleys of rifle fire, and a trench mortar bombardment that
burst with the deadliest effect among the attacking troops.</p>

<p>This trench mortar barrage of the British was one of the most awful
means of slaughter yesterday, especially when the enemy tried to cross
La Bass&eacute;e Canal further north, and in that sector the infantry
and gunner officers say more Germans were killed yesterday along the
canal bank than on any other day since the fighting in this
neighborhood. One battery of trench mortars did most deadly execution
until their pits were surrounded, and only two of their crews were able
to escape.</p>

<p>The machine gunners fought out in the open after some of their
positions had been wiped out by gunfire, caught the enemy waves at fifty
yards' range, and mowed them down; but the enemy was not checked for a
long time, despite his losses, and when one body fell another came up to
fill its place and press on into any gap that had been made by their
artillery or their own machine-gun sections.</p>

<p>There was one such momentary gap
<a class="pagenum" id="page_400" title="pg 400"> </a>
between a body of the Black Watch, who had been weakened by shellfire,
and some of their comrades further north, and into this the enemy tried
to force a way. Other Scottish troops were in reserve, and when it
became clear that a portion of the line was endangered by this turning
movement they came forward with grim intent, and by a fierce
counterattack swept through the gap and flung back the enemy, so that
the position was restored.</p>

<p>Further north some Gloucesters were fighting the enemy both ways, as
once before in history, when they fought back to back, thereby winning
the honor of wearing their cap badge back and front, which they do to
this day. The Germans had worked behind them as well as in front of
them, and they were in a tight corner, but did not yield, and finally,
after hard fighting, cleared the ground about them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile further south some Lancashire troops on the canal lost some
parts of their front line under an intense bombardment, but still fought
on in the open, repulsing every effort to drive them back and smashing
the enemy out of their positions, so that only remnants of the German
outposts clung on until late last night, up to which time there was
savage strife on both sides.</p>

<h3>FIGHTING FOR THE CANAL</h3>

<p>Extraordinary scenes took place on the canal bank when the enemy
tried to cross. In the twilight of early dawn a party came out of a wood
and tried to get across the water, but was seen by the British machine
gunners and shot down.</p>

<p>Then another body of men advanced and carried with them a floating
bridge, but when those who were not hit reached the water's edge they
found the bridge as fixed did not reach to the other side. Some of them
walked on it, expecting perhaps to jump the gap, but were shot off, and
other men on the bank also were caught under British fire.</p>

<p>A Corporal went down to the canal edge and flung hand grenades at the
Germans still struggling to fix the bridge, and then a Lieutenant and a
few men rushed down and pulled the bridge on to their side of the
bank.</p>

<p>Later this young officer saw one of the British pontoons drifting
down and swam to it and made it fast beyond the enemy's reach, but in a
position so that some of his men ran across and caught the enemy under
their fire on his side of the canal.</p>

<p>At 7 o'clock yesterday morning, while a handkerchief was hoisted by
the enemy, three hundred of them made signs of surrender. Some of them
changed their minds at the last moment and ran away, but 150 gave
themselves up, and some of them swam the canal in order to reach our
side for this purpose. They were shivering in their wet clothes and in
the northeast wind, which lashed over the battle lines yesterday, and
they were very miserable men.</p>

<h3>THE BELGIAN VICTORY</h3>

<p><i>Mr. Gibbs declares that had the Germans been able to pass Givenchy
or cross the canal north of B&eacute;thune on the 18th and 19th the
result would have proved disastrous. He gives credit for the repulse to
the British and French combined lines. He thus describes the achievement
of the Belgians on April 17</i>:</p>

<p>The Germans on the 17th pressed the attack in force against the
Belgians. Besides three regiments of the 1st Landwehr Division usually
holding this sector, between the Ypres-Staden railway and Kippe, they
brought up from Dixmude&mdash;poor Dixmude, into whose flaming ruins I
went when it was first bombarded in October, 1914&mdash;two regiments of
the 6th Bavarian Division, and from the coast the 5th Matrosen Regiment
of the 2d Naval Division, with a regiment of the 58th Saxons. It was a
heavy force, and they hoped to surprise and annihilate the Belgian
resistance by their weight and quickness of attack.</p>

<p>The Belgians were waiting for them, standing, too, in those swampy
fields which they have held against the enemy for three and a half
years, always shelled, always paying daily a toll of life and limb, not
getting much glory or recognition because of the great battles
elsewhere, but patient and enduring as when I knew them on the Yser in
the first dreadful Winter of the war, and their little regular army
fought to a finish.</p>

<p>Even before the battle the German marines,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_401" title="pg 401"> </a>
Saxon troops, and Landwehr suffered misery and lost many men. They lay
out in the flat, wet fields two nights previously, and were very cold,
and scared by the Belgian gunfire which burst among them. They had no
great artillery behind them, and the Saxons and German sailors now
prisoners of the Belgians curse bitterly because they were expected to
get through easily in spite of this.</p>

<h3>Germans Cut Off</h3>

<p>The enemy's intention was to take Bixschoote and advance across the
Yser Canal, driving south to Poperinghe. What they did by their massed
attacks was to penetrate to a point near Hoekske, southeast of Merckem,
the main weight of their pressure being directed along the Bixschoote
road. The Belgians delivered a quick counterattack, with wonderful
enthusiasm among officers and men. They had perfect knowledge of the
country, and used this fully by striking up from a place called Luyghem
in such a way that the enemy was driven toward the swamp, where any who
went in sank up to his neck in the ice-cold water.</p>

<p>The Germans were cut off from their own lines and trapped. Seven
hundred of them surrendered, men of all the regiments I have mentioned,
and they seemed to think themselves lucky at getting off so cheaply,
though they quailed when they were brought back through the towns behind
the lines, and the Belgian women, remembering many things, raised a cry
as these men passed. It was not a pleasant sound. I heard it once in
France when a German officer passed through with an escort. It was a cry
which made my blood run cold. But there is gladness among the Belgian
troops, for they had long waited for their chance of striking, and made
good.</p>

<h3>Heroism of the Doctors</h3>

<p>As heroic a story as anything in all this history of the last four
weeks is that of the medical officers, nurses, orderlies, and ambulance
men belonging to these casualty clearing stations, who were not far
behind the fighting lines when the battle began on March 21.</p>

<p>And then in a few hours they were on the
very edge of the enemy's advancing tide, so
that they were almost caught by it and had
to make brave efforts to rescue the wounded,
save their equipment, and get away to a
place where for a little while again they
could go on with their noble work until the
red edge of war swept up with its fire again
and they had to retreat still further.</p>

<p>I used to pass very often the outer ring of
those casualty clearing stations on the right
of the British line beyond Bapaume, in
the Cambrai salient, and away toward St.
Quentin.</p>

<p>They were almost caught on that day of
March 21 when the infernal bombardment
was flung over a wide belt of the British
lines, and the enemy stormed the defenses
and the British fought back in heroic rearguard
actions. It became a question of only
a few hours, sometimes of the last quarter
of an hour, when these brave medical officers
with the nurses and orderlies could get away.</p>

<p>It is always the rule of patients first, and
at Ham there were 1,200 wounded, and many
others in other places. The railways were
choked with military transport or destroyed
by shellfire. On the roads refugees were
mixed up with the transport and guns and
troops. It was a frightful problem, but the
medical staffs did not lose their nerve, and
set about the business of removal with fine
skill and discipline.</p>

<h3>Caring for the Wounded</h3>

<p>What wounded could walk were gathered
together and sent on to the roads to make
their way back as far as their strength
would carry them. The badly wounded were
packed into all the available ambulances
and sent away. The equipment had sometimes
to be put on any train, regardless of
its destination. It was gathered in afterward
from whatever place it went to.</p>

<p>A casualty clearing station of 1,000 beds
needs 100 lorries to move it, but nine lorries
take a full kit for 200 beds, and always nine
lorries moved off first after the wounded to
take up a new station further back and carry
on. The medical officers looked after the
surgical instruments and trundled them along
the roads on wheeled stretchers. One officer
went twenty-five miles this way and another
seventeen miles. The sisters, after the
wounded had left, were put on any vehicle
going back from the battleline.</p>

<p>During these days I saw them squeezed between
drivers and men on motor lorries, sitting
among the Tommies in transport
wagons, one at least on a gun limber, and
others perched on top of forage, still merry
and bright in spite of all the tragedy about
them, because that is their training and their
faith.</p>

<p>In this retreat one poor sister was killed
and another wounded. Many of them, with
the medical officers, lost their kits. At
Achiet le Grand, on March 21, a shell killed
eight orderlies and blew out the back of the
operating theatre, and at another village on a
second night, three ambulances were smashed
up by bombs. Two drivers, with some of
their patients, were killed, but all the
wounded were brought away from the outer
ring of casualty clearing stations safely, and
then from the second ring through Roye and
Marincourt, Dernacourt, and Aveluy.</p>

<p>At Roye there was no time to spare, owing
to the enemy's rapid advance, and seventy
patients remained with a medical officer and
twelve orderlies until they could be rescued,
if there was any possible chance. There
seemed at first no chance, but on the way
back to Villers-Bretonneux the medical officer
<a class="pagenum" id="page_402" title="pg 402"> </a>
in command of the first convoy met some
motor ambulances and begged the drivers
to go into Roye and rescue those who had
been left behind. They went bravely and
brought away all the wounded and the staff,
and had no time to spare, because the last
ambulance came under the German rifle fire.</p>

<p>It is a strange and wonderful thing that the
patients do not seem to be harmed in any
way by this excitement and fatigue, and one
of the chiefs who made a tour of inspection
of all his clearing stations at this time tells
us he found all the wounded in good condition
and apparently no worse for their experience.</p>

<h3>Fall of Villers-Bretonneux</h3>

<p><i>
On April 24 the Germans attacked the important
village of Villers-Bretonneux, near
Amiens; it is on a hill above the Somme, and
was used as a corps headquarters and administrative
office by the British. The attack
was in great force, including tanks, the
first time they had been used by the Germans.</i></p>

<p><i>The initial assault was a success and the
Germans took the village and advanced
nearly a mile beyond&mdash;but let Mr. Gibbs tell
the rest:</i></p>

<p>During the night they were driven out by
Australian troops, who, by a most skillful
and daring piece of generalship, were sent
forward in the darkness without preliminary
artillery preparation, and, relying absolutely
on the weapons they carried to regain this
important portion, which gave the enemy full
observation of the British positions on both
sides of the Somme Valley beyond Amiens.</p>

<p>The splendid courage of the Australian
troops, the cunning of their machine gunners,
and the fine leadership of their officers
achieved success, and, in conjunction with
English battalions, they spent the night clearing
out the enemy from the village, where
he made a desperate resistance, and brought
back altogether
something like 700 or 800
prisoners.</p>

<p>It was a complete reversal of fortune for
the enemy, and in this twenty-four hours
of fighting he has lost great numbers of
men, whose bodies lie in heaps between Villers-Bretonneux
and Warfusee and all about
the ruins and fields in that neighborhood.</p>

<h3>First German Tanks</h3>

<p>The attack on Villers-Bretonneux was made
by four divisions. They were the 4th Guards,
the 77th, quite new to this phase of the war,
the 228th, and the 243d. They were in the
full strength of divisions, twelve regiments
in each, and a great weight of men on such a
narrow front against one British division,
whose men had already been under frightful
fire and had been living in clouds of poison
gas with masks on.</p>

<p>An officer of the Middlesex was in a bit
of a trench when the first German tank attacked
his men on the east side of the village,
and it went right over him as he lay
crouched, and traveled on, accompanied by
bodies of troops.</p>

<p>The Middlesex and West Yorks put up a
great fight but had to give ground to superior
numbers. The East Lancashires, who were
the garrison of Villers-Bretonneux, were also
attacked with great odds, and after a brave
resistance fell back with the general line,
which took up a position toward the end of
this first phase of the battle west of Villers-Bretonneux
and in the edge of Bois Abb&eacute;
to the left of it. Into this wood in the course
of the day a German patrol of one officer
and forty men made their way and stayed
there out of touch with their own men, and
were taken prisoners last night.</p>

<h3>The Night Battle</h3>

<p>The attack by the Australians was made
after 10 o'clock at night. It was difficult to
attack suddenly like this. There was no
artillery preparation. There should have
been a moon, but by bad luck it was veiled
in a thick, wet mist.</p>

<p>It was decided by the Australian General
that his men should go straight into the attack
with bayonet and machine gun, not
waiting for artillery protection which would
tell the enemy what was coming.</p>

<p>The plan of attack was to push forward
in two bodies and to encircle Villers-Bretonneux,
while some Northamptons and others
were in the centre with the order to fight
through the village from the north. This
manoeuvre was carried out owing to the
magnificent courage of each Australian soldier
and the gallantry of the officers.</p>

<p>The Germans fought desperately when they
found themselves in danger of being trapped.
They had nests of machine guns along the
railway embankment below the village, and
these fired fiercely, sweeping the attackers
who tried to advance upon them.</p>

<p>Those who worked around north and east
of the village also came under a burst of
machine-gun fire from weapons hidden among
the ruins and trenches, but they rounded up
the enemy and fought him from one bit of
ruin to another in streets which used to be
filled with civilian life only a few weeks ago
and crowded with staff officers and staff
cars, but now were littered with dead bodies
and raked by bullets.</p>

<p>The Australians captured two light field
guns, which the enemy had brought up in
the morning, according to his present habit
of advancing guns behind his third wave of
men, and several minenwerfer and many
machine guns.</p>

<h3>Great Piles of Dead</h3>

<p>During the night they and the English
troops seized over 500 men as prisoners and
sent them back, and several hundred seem
to have been routed out. Today, [the 25th,]
judging from these I saw myself, the living
were not so many as the dead.</p>

<p>It was fierce fighting in Villers-Bretonneux
<a class="pagenum" id="page_403" title="pg 403"> </a>
and around it last night and this morning
the enemy fought until put out by bayonet,
rifle bullet, or machine gun. The Australian
officers say that they have never seen such
piles of dead, not even outside of Bullecourt
or Lagnicourt last year, as those who lie
about this village of frightful strife.</p>

<p>The German tanks, which were first seen
in this battle, though heavier than the
British, with bigger guns, have now beaten a
retreat, leaving one of their type in No Man's
Land. The tank has a high turret and thick
armor plates, and is steered and worked on a
different system from the British. One of
them was "killed" by a tank of the old
British class, and then the British put in
some of the newer, faster, and smaller types,
which can steer almost as easily as a motor
car, as I know, because I have traveled in one
at great pace over rough ground.</p>

<p>These set out to attack bodies of German
infantry of the 77th Division forming up
near Cachy. It was a terrible encounter,
and when they returned this morning their
flanks were red with blood. They slew Germans
not by dozens nor by scores, but by
platoons and companies. They got right
among the masses of men and swept them
with fire, and those they did not kill with
their guns they crushed beneath them,
manoeuvring about and trampling them down
as they fell. It seems to have been as bloody
a slaughter as anything in this war.</p>

<h3>Battle for Kemmel Hill</h3>

<p><i>The furious battle for the possession of
Kemmel Hill, an eminence of strategic importance
in the Ypres region, occurred April
25, 26, and 27, and was as sanguinary as any
in Flanders. Although the Germans won the
hill, their victory involved such colossal sacrifices
that this deadly thrust ended their
serious offensive for the time. Mr. Gibbs's
description of this battle in part follows:</i></p>

<p>After several attempts against Kemmel
had been frustrated the enemy all went out,
April 25, to capture this position. Four divisions
at least, including the Alpine Corps, the
11th Bavarians, and the 5th, 6th, and 107th,
were moved against Kemmel in the early
morning fog after a tremendous bombardment
of the Franco-British positions. It was a
bombardment that begun before the first
glimmer of dawn, like one of those which
the British used to arrange in the days of
their great Flanders battles last year. It
came down swamping Kemmel Hill so that
it was like a volcano, and stretched away on
to the British lines on the left of the French
by Maedelstede Farm and Grand Bois down
to Vierstraat.</p>

<p>Then the German infantry attacked in
depth, battalion behind battalion, division
behind division, and their mountain troops of
Alpine Corps and J&auml;gers and Bavarians
came on first in the assault of Kemmel Hill,
which was not much more than a hillock,
though it looms large in Flanders, and in
this war. The French had suffered a terrible
ordeal of fire, and the main thrust of
the German strength was against them.</p>

<h3>Foe Strikes in Two Directions</h3>

<p>The enemy struck in two directions to encircle
the hill and village of Kemmel, one
arrowhead striking to Dranoutre and the
other at the point of junction between the
French and British northward.</p>

<p>In each case they were favored by fog and
the effect of their gunfire. They were able
to drive in a wedge which they pushed forward
until they had caused gaps. The
French on Kemmel Hill became isolated and
there was a gulf between the British and the
French and between the French left and
right.</p>

<p>On the hill the French garrison fought with
splendid heroism. These men, when quite
surrounded, would not yield, but served their
machine guns and rifles for many hours, determined
to hold their positions at all costs,
and to the death. Small parties of them on
the west of the hill held out until midday or
beyond, according to the reports of the airmen,
who flew low over them, but by 9
o'clock this morning, owing to the gaps made
by the enemy, the French main line was
compelled to draw back from Kemmel.</p>

<p>They inflicted severe losses on the enemy
as they fell back and thwarted his efforts
to break their line on the new defensive
positions. Meanwhile a body of Scottish
troops were seriously involved. Some of their
officers whom I saw today tell me the fog
was so thick, as on March 21, that after a
terrific bombardment the first thing known
at some points a little way behind the line
was when the Germans were all around them.</p>

<h3>Germans Under Von Arnim</h3>

<p>The German army of assault upon Kemmel
and the surrounding country was under command
of General Sixt von Arnim, who was
the leading opponent of the Allies in the
long struggle of the first Somme battles, and
whose clear and ruthless intelligence was
revealed in the famous document summing
up the first phase of that fighting, when he
frankly confessed to many failures of organization
and supply, but with acute criticism
which was not that of a weak or indecisive
man.</p>

<p>Under his command as corps commanders
were Generals Seiger and von Eberhardt,
and they had picked troops, including the
Alpine Corps and strong Bavarian and Prussian
divisions specially trained for assault in
such country as that of Kemmel. Their plan
of attack to strike at the points of junction
between the French and British east of
Kemmel, and also at the French troops south
of it, near Dranoutre, proved for the time
successful, and by driving in wedges they
were able to make the Allies fall back on the
flanks and encircle Kemmel Hill after furious
and heroic fighting by the French and British
troops.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_404" title="pg 404"> </a></p>

<p>The British now were in weak numbers
compared with the strength brought against
them. Their withdrawal to the new lines of
defense by Vierstraat and the furious attacks
across the Ypres-Comines Canal gave
the enemy some ground in the region of St.
Eloi and the bluff and the spoil bank of the
canal itself. It is villainous ground there,
foul with wreckage of the old fighting.</p>

<p>British troops and Canadian troops were put
to the supreme test of courage to take and
hold these places. The glorious old 3d Division,
commanded in those days of 1915 and
1916 by General Haldane, fought from St.
Eloi to the bluff, month in and month out,
and lost many gallant officers and men there
after acts of courage which belong to history.</p>

<p>German storm troops made three violent
attacks on Locre, which were flung back by
the French, with heavy casualties among the
enemy, and it was only at the fourth attempt
with fresh reserves that they were able to
enter the ruins of the village, from which
the French then fell back in order to reorganize
for a counterattack. This they
launched today at an early hour, and now
Locre is in their hands after close fighting,
in which they slew numbers of the enemy.</p>

<p>After their success on April 25, when they
captured Kemmel, the Germans have made
little progress, and, though there was fierce
fighting all day yesterday, they failed to
gain their objectives, and were raked by fire
hour after hour, so that large numbers of
their dead lie on the field of battle. At 4 in
the afternoon they engaged in fresh assaults
upon the positions near Ridge Wood, to
which the line had fallen back, but English
and Scottish troops repulsed them and scattered
their waves. It was a bad day for
them because of their great losses. The British
have broken the fighting quality of some
of the enemy's most renowned regiments.</p>

<h3>The Country Devastated</h3>

<p>All the roads and camps around Ypres are
under a heavy, harassing fire once more,
Ypres itself being savagely bombarded by
high-explosive and gas shells, so that after
some months of respite those poor ruins are
again under that black spell which makes
them the most sinister place in the world.
Suicide Corner has come into its own again,
and the old unhealthy plague spots up by
the canal are under fire.</p>

<p>The enemy's guns are reaching out to fields
and villages hitherto untouched by fire, and
these harassing shots, intended, perhaps, to
catch traffic on the roads or soldiers' camps,
often serve the enemy no more than by the
death of innocent women and children. A
day or two ago a monstrous shell fell just
outside a little Flemish cottage tucked away
in an angle of a road which I often pass. It
scooped out a deep pit in the garden without
even scarring the cottage walls, but two
children were playing in the garden and were
laid dead beside a flower bed.</p>

<p>Yesterday a small boy I know went grubbing
about this plot of earth and brought
back a great chunk of shell bigger than his
head. Those are the games children play in
this merry century of ours. They are astoundingly
indifferent to the perils about
them, and sleep o' nights to the thunder of
gunfire not very far away, or slip their heads
under the bedclothes when bombs fall near.</p>

<p>But older folk find this gradual creeping up
of the war a nervous strain and a mental
agony which keeps them on the rack. It is
pitiful to watch their doubts and perplexities
and their clinging on to their homes and
property. Shells smash outlying cottages to
dust with their people inside them, but still
the people in the village itself stay on, hoping
against hope that the Germans' guns have
reached their furthest range.</p>

<p>"I shall not go till the first shell falls in
the middle of the square," said a girl.</p>

<p>Another woman said:</p>

<p>"If I go I lose all I have in life, so I will
risk another day."</p>

<p>They take extraordinary risks, and our
officers and men find some of them on the
very battlefields and in farmyards where
they unlimber their guns.</p>

<h3>Heavy German Losses</h3>

<p>The enemy's losses in this continual fighting
have been severe. We have been able to
get actual figures of some of their casualties,
which are typical of the more general effect
of the British fire. Of one company of the
7th German Division which fought at St.
Eloi on Friday only 40 men remained out
of its full strength of 120.</p>

<p>The 4th Ersatz Division lost most
heavily, and a prisoner of the 279th Pioneer
Company, which relieved the 360th Regiment
of that division, says the average company
strength was fifteen men.</p>

<p>The entire regimental staff was killed by
a direct hit of a British shell on their headquarters
dugout near Cantieux. The same
thing happened to the battalion headquarters
of the 223d Regiment, which is now in a state
of low morale, having been fearfully cut up.</p>

<p>The 1st Guards Reserve Regiment of the
1st Guards Division, which was much weakened
in the fighting on the Somme and afterward
was sent to La Bass&eacute;e, lost thirty-six
officers, including a regimental commander
and one battalion commander. These
losses are affecting inevitably the outlook
of the German troops on the prospects of
their continued offensive.</p>

<p>Prisoners from divisions which suffered
most confess they have no further enthusiasm
for fighting, and that their regiments can
only be made to attack by stern discipline
and the knowledge that they must fight on
or be shot for desertion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the best German troops,
especially those now attacking in Flanders,
like the Alpine Corps and 11th Bavarian Division,
are elated and full of warlike spirit.</p>

<p>Even their prisoners profess to believe they
<a class="pagenum" id="page_405" title="pg 405"> </a>
are winning the war and will have a German
peace before the year is out.</p>

<h3>Desperate Fighting for Ypres</h3>

<p><i>The Germans vainly launched desperate attacks
of unexampled fury against the British
and French lines in the Ypres region on April
29. Mr. Gibbs in his cable dispatch of that
date thus refers to these assaults:</i></p>

<p>It becomes clearer every hour that the enemy
suffered a disastrous defeat today. Attack
after attack was smashed up by the
British artillery and infantry, and he has
not made a foot of ground on the British
front.</p>

<p>The Border Regiment this morning repulsed
four heavy assaults on the Kemmel-La Clytte
road, where there was extremely hard fighting,
and destroyed the enemy each time.</p>

<p>One of the enemy's main thrusts was between
Scherpenberg and Mont Rouge, where
they made a wedge for a time and captured
the crossroads, and it was here that a gallant
French counterattack swept them back.</p>

<p>The British had no more than a post or two
in Voormezeele this morning, and the enemy
was there in greater strength, and sent his
storm troops through this place, but was
never able to advance against the fire of the
British battalions.</p>

<p>His losses began yesterday, when his troops
were seen massing on the road between
Zillebeke and Ypres in a dense fog, through
which he attempted to make a surprise attack.
This was observed by low-flying
planes, and his assembly was shattered by
gunfire. After a fierce shelling all night, so
tremendous along the whole northern front
that the countryside was shaken by its
tumult, German troops again assembled in
the early morning mist, but were caught once
more in the British bombardment.</p>

<p>At 3 o'clock a tremendous barrage was
flung down by the German gunners from
Ypres to Bailleul, and later they began the
battle by launching first an attack between
Zillebeke Lake and Meteren. South of Ypres
they crossed the Yser Canal by Lock 8, near
Voormezeele, which was their direction of
attack against the British, while they tried
to drive up past Locre against the French on
the three hills.</p>

<p>The successful defense has made the day
most bloody for many German regiments.</p>

<h3>Enemy's Attacks Futile</h3>

<p>In order to turn them if frontal attacks
failed against the French, German storm
troops&mdash;they are now called grosskampf, or
great offensive troops&mdash;were to break the
British lines on the French left between
Locre and Voormezeele and on the French
right near Merris and Meteren. That obviously
was the intention of the German High
Command this morning, judging from their
direction of assault.</p>

<p>So far they have failed utterly. They
failed to break or bend the British wings on
the French centre, and they failed to capture
the hills, or any one of them, defended by
the French divisions.</p>

<p>They have attacked again and again since
this morning's dawn, heavy forces of German
infantry being sent forward after their
first waves against Scherpenberg and Voormezeele,
which lies to the east of Dickebusch
Lake, but these men have been slaughtered
by the French and British fire and made no
important progress at any point.</p>

<p>For a time the situation seemed critical
at one or two points, and it was reported
that the Germans had been storming the
slopes of Mont Rouge and Mont Noir, but
one of the British airmen flew over these
hills at 200 feet above their crests, and could
see no German infantry near them.</p>

<p>Round about Voormezeele, North Country
and other English battalions had to sustain
determined and furious efforts of Alpine and
Bavarian troops to drive through them by
weight of numbers, after hours of intense
bombardment, but the men held their ground
and inflicted severe punishment upon the
enemy.</p>

<p>All through the day the German losses have
been heavy under field-gun and machine-gun
fire, and the British batteries, alongside the
French seventy-fives, swept down the enemy's
advancing waves and his masses assembled
in support at short range.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the French guarding
the three hills have fought with extreme
valor and skill. For a brief period the Germans
apparently were able to draw near and
take some of the ground near Locre, but an
immediate counterattack was organized by
the French General, and the line of French
troops swung forward and swept the enemy
back. Further attacks by the Germans north
of Ypres and on the Belgian front were repulsed
easily, and again the enemy lost
many men.</p>

<h3>French and British Valor</h3>

<p><i>On April 30 Mr. Gibbs confirmed the details
of the disastrous German defeats on the two
preceding days and gave these further particulars:</i></p>

<p>It was the valor of Frenchmen as well as
Englishmen which yesterday inflicted defeat
upon many German divisions, and the Allies
fought side by side, and their batteries fired
from the same fields and their wounded
came back along the same roads, and the
khaki and blue lay out upon the same brown
earth.</p>

<p>I have already given an outline of yesterday's
battle, how, after a colossal bombardment,
the German attack early in the morning
from north of Ypres to south of Voormezeele,
where English battalions held the lines,
and from La Clytte past the three hills of
Scherpenberg, Mont Rouge, and Mont Noir,
which French troops held to the north of
Meteren, where the English joined them;
again, how the English Tommies held firm
<a class="pagenum" id="page_406" title="pg 406"> </a>
against desperate assaults until late in the
evening; how the enemy made a great thrust
against the French, driving in for a time between
Scherpenberg and Mont Noir until
they were flung back by a French counterattack.</p>

<p>In the night the French, who had now regained
all the ground that had been temporarily
in the enemy's hands, made a general
counterattack and succeeded in advancing
their line to a depth of about fifteen hundred
yards beyond the line of the three hills, which
thereby was made more secure against future
assaults.</p>

<h3>Deadly Machine-Gun Work</h3>

<p>Meanwhile throughout the day the English
battalions had been sustaining heavy
assaults, breaking the enemy against their
front. The Leicesters, especially, had fierce
fighting about Voormezeele, where, as I told
yesterday, the enemy was in the centre of
the village. German storm troops advanced
against our men here and along other parts
of the line with fixed bayonets, but in most
places, except Voormezeele, where there was
close fighting, they were mowed down by
Lewis-gun fire before they could get near.
Line after line of them came on, but lost
heavily and fell back.</p>

<p>Over the ground east of Dickebusch Lake
some Yorkshire troops saw these groups of
field gray men advancing upon them, and the
glint of their bayonets, wet in the morning
mist, and swept them with bullets from the
Lewis guns and rifles until heaps of bodies
were lying out there on the mud flats in the
old Ypres salient. The most determined
assaults were concentrated upon the 25th
Division, but it held firm and would not
budge, though the men had been under fearful
fire in the night bombardment, and their
machine gunners kept their triggers pressed,
and bullets played upon the advancing Germans
like a stream from a garden hose.</p>

<p>The troops in the whole division yielded no
yard of ground and they hold that they
killed as many Germans as any battalion in
this battle. It was a black day for Germany.
More than ten German divisions, probably
thirteen, seem to have been engaged in this
attempt to smash our lines and encircle the
three hills. They included some of the
enemy's finest divisions, so they lost quality
as well as quantity in this futile sacrifice of
man-power&mdash;man-power which seems to mean
nothing in flesh and blood and heart and soul
to men like Ludendorff, but is treated as a
material force like guns and ammunition and
used as cannon fodder.</p>

<h3>Brilliant French Fighters</h3>

<p><i>Referring to the French troops in this battle,
Mr. Gibbs wrote:</i></p>

<p>Today again I have been among the thousands
of French soldiers. It is splendid to
see them because of their fine bearing. They
are men in the prime of life, not so young as
some of the British and with a graver look
than one sees on British faces, when they
have not yet reached the zone of fire. They
are men who have seen all that war means
during these years of agony and hope and
boredom and death. They have no illusions.
They stare into the face of death unflinchingly
and shrug their shoulders at its worst
menace and still have faith in victory.</p>

<p>So I read them, if any man may read the
thoughts that lie behind those bronzed faces
with the dark eyes and upturned mustaches
under the blue painted helmets or the black
Tam o' Shanters.</p>

<p>They are not gay or boisterous in their
humor, and they do not sing like the British
as they march, but they seem to have been
born to this war, and its life is their life, and
they are professionals.</p>

<p>The Tricolor passes along the roads of
France and Flanders, and French trumpets
ring out across the flat fields below Scherpenberg,
and all the spirit of the French
fighting men, who have proved themselves
great soldiers in this war, as for thousands
of years of history, is mingled with our own
battalions. Together yesterday they gave
the German Army a hard knock.</p>

<h3>The British Guards</h3>

<p><i>In his cable of May 1 Mr. Gibbs gave details
of the extraordinary heroism of the
British Guards. He related incidents which
had occurred April 11 to 14, after the Germans
had broken through the Portuguese in
their efforts to widen the gap between Armenti&egrave;res
and Merville by gaining the crossings
of the Lys.</i></p>

<p>The Grenadier, Irish, and Coldstream
Guards were sent forward along the Hazebrouck-Estaires
road when the situation was
at its worst, when the men of the 15th Division
and other units had fought themselves
out in continual rearguard and holding actions,
so that some of those still in the line
could hardly walk or stand, and when it was
utterly necessary to keep the Germans in
check until a body of Australian troops had
time to arrive. The Guards were asked to
hold back the enemy until those Australians
came and to fight at all costs for forty-eight
hours against the German tide of men and
guns which was attempting to flow around
the other hard pressed men, and that is what
the Guards did, fighting in separate bodies
with the enemy pressing in on both flanks.</p>

<p>Greatly outnumbered, they beat back attack
after attack, and gained precious hours,
vital hours, by the most noble self-sacrifice.
A party of Grenadiers were so closely surrounded
that their officer sent back a message
saying:</p>

<p>"My men are standing back to back and
shooting on all sides."</p>

<p>The Germans swung around them, circling
them with machine guns and rifles and pouring
a fire into them until only eighteen men
were left. Those eighteen, standing among
<a class="pagenum" id="page_407" title="pg 407"> </a>
their wounded and their dead, did not surrender.
The army wanted forty-eight hours.
They fixed bayonets and went out against
the enemy and drove through him. A
wounded Corporal of Grenadiers, who afterward
got back to the British lines, lay in a
ditch, and the last he saw of his comrades
was when fourteen men of them were still
fighting in a swarm of Germans.</p>

<h3>Fought Back to Back</h3>

<p>The Coldstream Guards were surrounded in
the same way and fought in the same way.
The army had asked for forty-eight hours
until the Australians could come, and many
of the Coldstreamers eked out the time with
their lives. The enemy filtered in on their
flanks, came crawling around them with machine
guns, sniped them from short range and
raked them from ditches and upheaved earth.</p>

<p>The Coldstream Guards had to fall back,
but they fought back in small groups, facing
all ways and making gaps in the enemy's
ranks, not firing wildly, but using every
round of small-arms ammunition to keep a
German back and gain a little more time.</p>

<p>Forty-eight hours is a long time in a war
like this. For two days and nights the Irish
Guards, who had come up to support the
Grenadiers and Coldstreamers, tried to make
a defensive flank, but the enemy worked past
their right and attacked them on two sides.
The Irish Guards were gaining time. They
knew that was all they could do, just drag
out the hours by buying each minute with
their blood. One man fell and then another;
but minutes were gained, and quarters of
hours and hours.</p>

<p>Small parties of them lowered their bayonets
and went out among the gray wolves
swarming around them, and killed a number
of them until they also fell. First one party
and then another of these Irish Guards made
those bayonet charges against men with machine
guns and volleys of rifle fire. They
bought time at a high price, but they did not
stint themselves nor stop their bidding because
of its costliness.</p>

<p>The brigade of Guards here and near Vieux
Berquin held out for those forty-eight hours,
and some of them were fighting still when the
Australians arrived, according to the timetable.</p>

<h3>Carnage Near Locre</h3>

<p><i>Mr. Gibbs, in a dispatch dated May 3, gave
these vivid descriptions of the fighting in
the Locre-Dranoutre-Kemmel region:</i></p>

<p>On April 24 the German bombardment was
intensified and spread over a deep area, destroying
villages, tearing up roads, and making
a black vomit of the harrowed fields.
Dranoutre, Locre, Westoutre, and other
small towns were violently bombarded. That
night the French discovered that the Germans
were preparing an attack for the next
morning, to be preceded by a gas bombardment.
The officers warned all their men,
and they stood on the alert with gas masks
when at 3:30 in the morning thousands of
gas shells fell over them, mixed with high
explosives of all calibres up to the monster
twelve-inch, which burst like volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p>In the intensity of bombardment several
officers who fought at Fleury said: "This
is the most frightful thing we have seen.
Verdun was nothing to it."</p>

<p>All the French troops jammed on gas
masks, and on one day put them on fifty
times, only removing them when the wind,
which was fairly strong, blew away the
poison fumes until other storms of shells
came. For nearly a week they wore them
constantly, sleeping in them, officers giving
orders in them, and the men fighting and
dying in them and charging with the bayonet
in them. It was worth the trouble and suffering,
for this French regiment between
Locre and Dranoutre had only twelve gas
casualties.</p>

<p>That morning the German attack fell first
on Kemmel Hill, which they turned from
the north, and two hours later, the bombardment
continuing all along the line, they developed
a strong attack against Dranoutre in
the south in order to take Locre and turn
the French right. Until evening the troops
on Kemmel Hill, with a small body of British,
still held out with great devotion in
isolated positions, but by 8 o'clock that
morning Kemmel Hill was entirely cut off.</p>

<h3>Other British Units in Danger</h3>

<p>This was a severe menace to their comrades
at Locre and southward, because both
their flanks were threatened. They did heroic
things to safeguard their right and left,
which again and again the enemy tried to
pass. I have already told in a previous
message how a gallant French officer and
a small company of men made a counterattack
at Dranoutre and held the post there
against all odds.</p>

<p>Up by Locre the commandant of the left
battalion found machine-gun fire sweeping
his left flank, and his men had to face left
to defend their line. Small parties of Germans
with machine guns kept filtering down
from the north and established themselves
on the railway in order to rake the French
with an enfilade fire.</p>

<p>One French company, led by devoted
officers, counterattacked there five times
with the bayonet into the sweep of those
bullets, and by this sacrifice saved their
flank. Another company advanced to hold
the hospice. There was desperate fighting
day after day, so that its ruins, if any bits
of wall are left, will be as historic as the
ch&acirc;teau at Vermelles, or other famous houses
of the battlefields.</p>

<p>French and Germans took it turn and turn
about, and although the enemy sent great
numbers of men to garrison this place they
never were able to hold it long, because always
some young French Lieutenant and a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_408" title="pg 408"> </a>
handful of men stormed it again and routed
the enemy. When it was taken last on April
29, the day of the enemy's severe defeat,
the French captured 100 prisoners in the
cellars there, and they belonged to fourteen
battalions of four regiments of three divisions,
showing the amazing way in which the
enemy's divisions have been flung into confusion
by the French fire.</p>

<h3>Under Constant Shellfire</h3>

<p>On the morning of April 26 French companies
made six attacks, and in the afternoon
two more, and though their losses were
heavy, that evening both the village and
hospice of Locre stayed in their hands. That
night, their men being exhausted for a time
after so many hours under fire, they withdrew
their line a little to the Locre-Bailleul
road by the Ch&acirc;teau of Locre and west of
Dranoutre in order to reorganize a stronger
defense. The German bombardment slackened
on the morning of April 28 owing to fog,
and those few hours on that day and one
other were the only respite these French
troops had from the incessant and infernal
gunfire when, owing to open warfare, "en
rase campagne," as the French call it, as in
1914, without a complete system of trenches
or dugouts or other artificial cover, they were
much exposed.</p>

<p>"There were ten big shells a second," one
of these officers told me, "and that lasted,
with only two short pauses, for six days all
through the battle, and other shells were uncountable."</p>

<p>The enemy had brought up light artillery
and trench mortars almost to his front lines
in Dranoutre Wood and other places and attempted
to take the French in an enfilade
fire from Kemmel, but by this time many
French guns were in position, reinforcing the
British artillery, and on the 28th they opened
up and killed great numbers of the enemy.</p>

<p>Allied aviators saw long columns of Germans
on the roads by Neuve Eglise and in
Dranoutre Wood, and signaled to the guns
to range on these human targets. The guns
answered. Masses of Germans were smashed
by the fire and panicstricken groups were
seen running out of Dranoutre Wood.</p>

<h3>Night of Horror for Germans</h3>

<p>That night the Germans seemed to be relieving
their troops, and again the French
and British guns flung shells into them, and
for the enemy it was a night of death and
horror; but the next day, the 29th, the enemy
made reply by a prolonged bombardment,
more intense even than before, and then attacked
with new troops all along the line.
But the French also had many fresh troops
in line&mdash;not those I met yesterday&mdash;who at 2
o'clock in the morning went forward into attack
and took back the village. This defeated
the enemy's plan of turning the French
left.</p>

<p>All through that day the enemy's desperate
efforts to break through were shattered, and
that night the French held exactly the same
ground as before and had caused enormous
losses to the German divisions, at least 40
per cent. of their strength, as it is reckoned
on close evidence.</p>

<p>That night even the German guns stopped
their drumfire, as though Sixt von Arnim's
army was in mourning for its dead. It was
a night of strange and uncanny silence after
the stupendous tumult, but for those French
regiments who had been holding the line for
nearly a week it had been a day of supreme
ordeal.</p>

<h3>Preparing for Another Advance</h3>

<p><i>There were no general engagements during
the preceding five days nor up to May 18,
but incessant artillery fire was kept up and
raids were constantly made. On May 5 Mr.
Gibbs described the difficulties encountered
by the Germans in preparing for a new
advance:</i></p>

<p>The enemy has many divisions, both up in
the Flemish fields and on the Somme, divisions
in line and divisions in reserve&mdash;divisions
crowded in reserve&mdash;and there are few
roads for them down which to march. There
is not much elbow room for such masses to
assemble, and not much cover in trenches
or dugouts from high explosives or shrapnel.
So we pound them to death, many of them
to death and many of them to stretcher
cases, and relief comes up, gets wildly mixed
with the divisions coming down, and at night
there is mad confusion in the ranks of
marching men and transport columns, which
gallop past dead horses and splintered
wagons and wrecks of transport columns,
and among the regimental and divisional
staffs, trying to keep order in the German
way when things are being smashed into
chaos, while the Red Cross convoys are over-loaded
with wounded and unable to cope
with all the bodies that lie about.</p>

<p>This is what is happening behind the German
lines&mdash;I have not overdrawn the picture,
believe me&mdash;and it is upsetting somewhat
the plans of the high German officers
who are arranging things from afar through
telephones, down which they shout their
orders.</p>

<h3>"The Drums of Death"</h3>

<p><i>In his dispatch of May 9 the following was
written to describe the difficulties of the
Germans in reorganizing their battered
forces:</i></p>

<p>From many points the British have complete
observation of the enemy's positions
there, as he has of theirs from the other side
of the way, and, needless to say, they are
making use of this direct view by flinging
over storms of shells whenever his transport
is seen crawling along the tracks of the old
Somme battlefields or his troops are seen
massing among their shell craters.</p>

<p>The town of Albert itself, where once until
<a class="pagenum" id="page_409" title="pg 409"> </a>
recent history the golden Virgin used to
lean downward with her babe outstretched
above the ruins, is now a death trap for the
German garrisons there and for any German
gunners who try to hide their batteries
among the red brick houses. By day and
night their positions are pounded with high
explosives and soaked in asphyxiating gas.</p>

<p>I went within 2,000 yards of it yesterday,
and saw the heaviest work of the British
upon it. It was a wonderful May day, as today
is, and the sun shone through a golden
haze upon the town. As I looked into Albert
and saw the shells smashing through, and then
away up the Albert-Bapaume road, past the
white rim of the great mine crater of La
Boiselle to the treeless slopes of Posi&egrave;res, and
over all that ground of hills and ditches to
the high, wooded distant right, with its few
dead stumps of trees, it was hard to believe
that all this was in the area of the German
Army, that the white, winding lines freshly
marked upon this bleak landscape were new
German trenches, and that the enemy's outposts
were less than 2,000 yards from where
I stood.</p>

<h3>Fritz Having a "Thin Time"</h3>

<p>Some siege gunners were lying on their
stomachs and observing the enemy's lines for
some monsters I had seen on my way up, monsters
that raised their snouts slowly, like elephants'
trunks, before bellowing out with an
earthquake roar, annihilating all one's
senses for a second. Some of the men passed
the remark to me that "Albert isn't the
town it was" and that "Fritz must be having
a thin time there." They also expressed
the opinion that the Albert-Bapaume road
was not a pleasant walk for Germans on a
sunny afternoon.</p>

<p>I did not dispute these points with them,
for they were beyond argument. Big shells
were smashing into Albert and its neighborhood
from many heavy batteries, raising volcanic
explosions there, and shrapnel was
bursting over the tracks in white splashes.</p>

<p><i>In describing the artillery fire which broke
up a threatened assault on May 5, Mr. Gibbs
wrote:</i></p>

<p>A new German division, the 52d Reserve,
and the 56th German Division prepared an
assault on Ridge Wood. All these men were
crowded into narrow assembly grounds and
did not have quiet hours before the moment
of attack. They had hours of carnage in the
darkness. British and French guns were
answering back the German bombardment
with their heaviest fire. French howitzers,
long-muzzled fellows, which during recent
weeks I had seen crawling through Flanders
with the cornflowers, as the French soldiers
call themselves, crowded about them on the
gun limbers and transport wagons and
muddy horses, and which had traveled long
kilometers, were now in action from their
emplacements between the ruined villages of
the Flemish war zone, and with their little
brothers, the soixante-quinzes, their blood-thirsty
little brothers, were savage in their
destruction and harassing fire.</p>

<p>I have seen the soixante-quinze at work
and have heard the rafale des tambours de la
mort&mdash;the ruffle of the drums of death&mdash;as
the sound of their fire is described by all soldier
writers of France. It was that fire, that
slashing and sweeping fire, which helped to
break up any big plan of attack against the
French troops yesterday morning, and from
those assembly places a great part of the
German infantry never moved all day, but
spent their time, it seems, in carrying back
their wounded.</p>

<h3>Tragic Desolation of Arras</h3>

<p><i>Mr. Gibbs on May 11 described a visit to
Arras, as follows:</i></p>

<p>Since the beginning of these great battles in
bleak, cold weather Spring has come, and almost
Summer, changing all the aspect of the
old battlefields and of the woods behind
craterland and of the cities under fire.</p>

<p>I went into one of those cities the other day,
Arras, which to me and to many of us out
here is a queerly enchanted place because of
its beauty, which survives even three years of
bombardment, and because of the many great
memories which it holds in its old houses
and streets and the sense of romance which
lurks in its courtyards and squares, reaching
back to ancient history before its death. For
Arras is dead and but the beautiful corpse
of the city that was once very fair and noble.</p>

<p>During the recent weeks the enemy has
flung many big explosive shells into it, so
that its ruins have become more ruined
and many houses hardly touched before have
now been destroyed. It was sad to see this
change, the fresh mangling of stones that
had already been scarred, the heaps of masonry
that lay piled about these streets that
were utterly deserted. I walked down many
of them and saw no living soul, only a few
lean cats which prowled about, slinking close
to the walls and crouching when a German
shell came over with a rending noise.</p>

<p>Bright sunlight shone down these streets,
putting a lazy glamour upon their broken
frontages and flinging back shadows from
high walls, except where shell holes let in
the light. The cathedral and the great Palace
of the Bishops were unroofed, with tall pillars
broken off below the vaulting and an avalanche
of white masonry about them. They
were clear-cut and dazzling under the blue
sky, and one was hushed by the tragic
grandeur of these ruins.</p>

<p>One of the British airplanes flew low over
the city, and its engine sang loudly with a
vibrant humming, and now and again the
crash of a gun or a shell loosened some stones
or plaster below its wings. Other birds were
singing. Spring birds, who are not out for
war but sweethearting in the gardens of
Arras.

<h2>America's Sacrifice</h2>

<h3>By Harold Begbie</h3>

<p class="center small">[By arrangement with The London Chronicle.]</p>

<p class="drop">One of the finest moral actions in this
war has been done by America.
It is action on a gigantic scale, and
yet of a directly personal character. Insufficient
publicity, I think, has been
given to this action.</p>

<p>Is it realized by the people of this
country that America has already saved
us from capitulating to the enemy?
Either we should have been forced into
this surrender (with our armies unbroken
and our munitions of war unexhausted)
or we should at this moment be
struggling to live and work and fight on
one-third of our present rations.</p>

<p>America is sending to these islands almost
two-thirds of our food supplies.
Sixty-five per cent. of the essential foodstuffs
eaten by the British citizen comes
to him from the American Continent.
This in itself is something which calls
for our lively gratitude. But there is a
quality in the action of America which
should intensify our gratitude. For
these American supplies, essential to our
health and safety, represent in very large
measure the personal and voluntary self-sacrifice
of the individual American
citizen. They are not crumbs from the
table of Dives. They are not the commandeered
supplies of an autocratic Government.
They represent, rather, the
kindly, difficult, and entirely willing
self-sacrifice of a whole nation, the vast
majority of whom are working people.</p>

<p>There is only one altar for this act of
sacrifice&mdash;it is the table of the American
working classes. And the rite is performed
by men, women, and children, at
every meal of the day, day after day,
week after week.</p>

<p>This act of self-sacrifice, let us remember,
is made in the midst of plenty. Well
might the American housewife ask why
she should deprive her children of food,
why she should institute wheatless and
meatless days, when all about her there
is a visible superabundance of these
things. Questions such as this are natural
enough on the other side of the Atlantic,
and on the other side of the American
continent, 5,000 miles away from the
battlefields of France.</p>

<p>But the citizens of America do not ask
such questions. With a cheerfulness and
a courage which are as vigorous as their
industry, and with a moral earnestness
which is by far the greatest demonstration
America has yet given to the world
of American character, these people so
far away from us on the other side of the
Atlantic have willingly and with no
coercion by the State denied themselves
for the sake of the Entente. They are
going short, they are going hungry, for
our sakes. They are practicing an intimate
self-sacrifice in order that we may
hold our own till their sons come to
fight at our side. All over America the
individual American citizen is making
this self-sacrifice, and making it without
a murmur. He is feeding, by his personal
self-sacrifice, not only these islands, but
France, Italy, and many of the neutrals.</p>

<p>This great demonstration of character
has had no other impetus than the simple
declaration of the facts by Herbert
Hoover, the man who fed Belgium.
Hoover has told his countrymen how
things stand. That is all. The Winter
of 1918, he declared to them, will prove
to mankind whether or not the American
Nation "is capable of individual self-sacrifice
to save the world." His propaganda
has never descended to unworthy
levels. He has appealed always to the
conscience of his countrymen. He has
spoken of "a personal obligation upon
every one of us toward some individual
abroad who will suffer privation to the
extent of our own individual negligence."</p>

<p>America has answered this appeal in a
manner which marks her out as one of
the greatest moral forces in the world.
It should be known out there, in the
farmhouses and cottages of the American
Continent, that the people of this
country are mindful of America's self-sacrifice,
and are grateful.</p>

<h2>American Soldiers in Battle</h2>

<h3>How They Repelled an Attack at Seicheprey
and Fought in Picardy</h3>

<p class="center small">[<span class="smcap">Month ended May 20, 1918</span>]</p>

<p class="drop">Seicheprey, in the Toul sector,
was the scene on April 20, 1918,
of the most determined attack
launched against the American
forces in France up to that time. A
German regiment, reinforced by storm
troops, a total of 1,500, was hurled
against the American positions on a one-mile
front west of Remi&egrave;res Forest,
northwest of Toul, after a severe bombardment
of gas and high explosive
shells. The Germans succeeded in penetrating
the front-line trenches and taking
the village of Seicheprey, but after
furious hand-to-hand fighting the American
troops recaptured the village and
most of the ground lost in the early
fighting.</p>

<p>Next morning, after a brief bombardment,
the Americans attacked and drove
the enemy out of the old outposts, which
they had gained, and thus broke down
an offensive which, it was believed, was
intended as the beginning of a German
plan to separate the Americans and the
French. The French lines also were attacked,
but the Germans were repulsed
and the lines re-established.</p>

<p>The losses were the heaviest sustained
by Americans since they began active
warfare in France. In a dispatch to the
War Department General Pershing indicated
that the losses among his men
were between 200 and 300. According
to the German official statement 183
Americans were taken prisoner, so that
the American casualties apparently came
mostly under the heading of captured.
Official reports of the German losses, according
to a prisoner captured later,
gave 600 killed, wounded, and missing.</p>

<h3>IN THE PICARDY BATTLE</h3>

<p>"Franco-American positions south of
the Somme and on the Avre" were officially
mentioned for the first time in the
French War Office report of April 24,
indicating that forces of the United
States were there on the battlefront resisting
the great German offensive. The
report stated that an intense bombardment
of the positions all along this front
was followed by an attack directed
against Hangard-en-Santerre, the region
of Hailles, and Senecat Wood. The Germans
were repulsed almost everywhere.</p>

<p>Formal announcement that American
troops sent to reinforce the allied armies
had taken part in the fighting was made
by the War Department in its weekly review
of the situation issued on April 29.
"Our own forces," the statement read,
"have taken part in the battle. American
units are in the area east of Amiens.
During the engagements which have
raged in this area they have acquitted
themselves well."</p>

<h3>UNDER INTENSE FIRE</h3>

<p>Another heavy attack was launched
by the Germans against the Americans
in the vicinity of Villers-Bretonneux on
April 30. It was repulsed with heavy
losses for the enemy. The German bombardment
opened at 5 o'clock in the afternoon
and was directed especially against
the Americans, who were supported on
the north and south by the French. The
fire was intense, and at the end of two
hours the German commander sent forward
three battalions of infantry. There
was hand-to-hand fighting all along the
line, as a result of which the enemy was
thrust back, his dead and wounded lying
on the ground in all directions. The
French troops were full of praise for the
manner in which the Americans conducted
themselves under trying circumstances,
especially in view of the fact
that they are fighting at one of the most
difficult points on the battlefront. The
American losses were rather severe.</p>

<p>The gallantry of the 300 American
engineers who were caught in the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_412" title="pg 412"> </a>
opening of the German offensive on
March 21 was the subject of a dispatch
from General Pershing made public by
the War Department on April 19. The
engineers were among the forces hastily
gathered by Major Gen. Sanderson
Carey, the British commander, who
stopped the gap in the line when General
Gough's army was driven back. [See
diagram on Page 389.] During the period
of thirteen days covered by General
Pershing's report, the engineers were
almost continuously in action. They
were in the very thick of the hardest
days of the great German drive in
Picardy.</p>

<p>General Pershing embodied in his report
a communication from General
Rawlinson, commander of the British
5th Army, in which the latter declared
that "it has been largely due to your
assistance that the enemy is checked."
The report covered the fighting period
from March 21 to April 3. The former
date marked the beginning of the Ludendorff
offensive along the whole front
from La F&egrave;re to Croisilles. It showed
that while under shellfire the American
engineers destroyed material dumps at
Chaulnes, that they fell back with the
British forces to Moreuil, where the commands
laid out trench work, and were
then assigned to a sector of the defensive
line at Demuin, and to a position near
Warfusee-Abancourt.</p>

<p>During the period of thirteen days
covered by the report the American engineers
had two officers killed and three
wounded, while twenty men were killed,
fifty-two wounded, and forty-five reported
missing.</p>

<h3>STORY OF CAREY EPISODE</h3>

<p>A correspondent of The Associated
Press at the front gave this account of
the part played by Americans in the historic
episode under General Carey:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A disastrous-looking gap appeared In
the 5th Army south of Hamel in the
later stages of the opening battle. The
Germans had crossed the Somme at
Hamel and had a clear path for a sweep
southwestward.</p>

<p>No troops were available to throw into
the opening. A certain Brigadier General
was commissioned by Major Gen.
Gough, commander of the 5th Army, to
gather up every man he could find and to
"hold the gap at any cost." The General
called upon the American and Canadian
engineers, cooks, chauffeurs, road workmen,
anybody he could find; gave them
guns, pistols, any available weapon, and
rushed them into the gap in trucks, on
horseback, or on mule-drawn limbers.</p>

<p>A large number of machine guns from
a machine-gun school near by were confiscated.
Only a few men, however, knew
how to operate the weapons, and they had
to be worked by amateurs with one "instructor"
for every ten or twelve guns.
The Americans did especially well in handling
this arm.</p>

<p>For two days the detachment held the
mile and a half gap. At the end of the
second day the commander, having gone
forty-eight hours without sleep, collapsed.
The situation of the detachment looked
desperate.</p>

<p>While all were wondering what would
happen next, a dusty automobile came
bounding along the road from the north.
It contained Brig. Gen. Carey, who had
been home on leave and who was trying
to find his headquarters.</p>

<p>The General was commandeered by the
detachment and he was found to be just
the commander needed. He is an old
South African soldier of the daredevil
type. He is famous among his men for
the scrapes and escapades of his school-boy
life as well as for his daring exploits
in South Africa.</p>

<p>Carey took the detachment in hand and
led it in a series of attacks and counterattacks
which left no time for sleeping
and little for eating. He gave neither his
men nor the enemy a rest, attacking first
on the north, then in the centre, then on
the south&mdash;harassing the enemy unceasingly
with the idea of convincing the Germans
that a large force opposed them.</p>

<p>Whenever the Germans tried to feel him
out with an attack at one point, Carey
parried with a thrust somewhere else,
even if it took his last available man, and
threw the Germans on the defensive.</p>

<p>The spirit of Carey's troops was wonderful.
The work they did was almost super-natural.
It would have been impossible
with any body of men not physical giants,
but the Americans and Canadians gloried
in it. They crammed every hour of the
day full of fighting. It was a constantly
changing battle, kaleidoscopic, free-for-all,
catch-as-catch-can. The Germans gained
ground. Carey and his men were back at
them, hungry for more punishment. At
the end of the sixth day, dog-tired and
battle-worn, but still full of fight, the
detachment was relieved by a fresh
battalion which had come up from the
rear.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>STAFF CHANGES</h3>

<p>Major Gen. James W. McAndrew, it
was announced on May 3, was appointed
Chief of Staff of the American expeditionary
force in succession to Brig. Gen.
James G. Harbord, who was assigned to
a command in the field. Other changes
on General Pershing's staff included the
appointment of Lieut. Col. Robert C.
Davis as Adjutant General, and Colonel
Merritte W. Ireland as Surgeon General.</p>

<p>The General Staff of the American expeditionary
forces in France, as the result
of several changes in personnel, consisted
on May 14, 1918, of the following:</p>

<p>President Wilson on May 4 pardoned
two soldiers of the American expeditionary
force who had been condemned to
death by a military court-martial in
France for sleeping on sentry duty and
commuted to nominal prison terms the
death sentences imposed on two others
for disobeying orders.</p>

<h3>HEALTH OF THE SOLDIERS</h3>

<p>Major Hugh H. Young, director of the
work of dealing with communicable blood
diseases in our army in France, made
this striking statement on May 12 regarding
the freedom of the American
expeditionary force from such diseases:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In making plans for this department of
medical work in France it had been calculated
by the medical authorities in
Washington to have ten 1,000-bed hospitals,
in which a million men could receive
treatment, but with 500,000 Americans
in France there is not one of the
five allotted Americans in any of the
hospitals now running, and only 500 cases
of this type of disease needing hospital
treatment, instead of the expected 5,000.</p>

<p>In other words, instead of having 1 per
cent. of our soldiers in hospitals from social
diseases, as had been expected, the
actual number is only one-tenth of 1 per
cent. There is no reason to doubt that
this record will be maintained. The hospitals
prepared for this special treatment
are to be used for other cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the American Army
is the cleanest in the world. The results,
according to Major Young, have been
achieved by preventive steps taken by
the American medical directors, coupled
with the co-operation of the men.</p>

<h2>Overseas Forces More Than Half a Million</h2>

<h3>Preparing for an Army of 3,000,000</h3>

<p class="drop">The overseas fighting forces of the
United States have been increasing
at a much more rapid rate than the
public was aware of. Early in May the
number of our men in France was in excess
of 500,000. A great increase in the
ultimate size of the army was further
indicated when the War Department
asked the House Military Affairs Committee
for a new appropriation of $15,000,000,000.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker, Secretary of War, appeared
before the committee on April 23 and,
after describing the results of his inspection
of the army in France, said that
the size of the army that the United
States would send abroad was entirely
dependent upon the shipping situation.
Troops were already moving to France
at an accelerated rate.</p>

<p>President Wilson, through Mr. Baker,
presented the House Military Affairs
Committee on May 2 with proposals for
increasing the army. The President
asked that all limits be removed on the
number of men to be drafted for service.
Mr. Baker said that he declined to discuss
the numbers of the proposed army
"for the double reason that any number
implies a limit, and the only possible
limit is our ability to equip and transport
men, which is constantly on the increase."
<a class="pagenum" id="page_414" title="pg 414"> </a></p>

<p>The Administration's plans were submitted
in detail on May 3, when the committee
began the preparation of the army
appropriation bill carrying $15,000,000,000
to finance the army during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1919. Mr. Baker
again refused to go into the question of
figures, but it became known at the
Capitol that the estimates he submitted
were based on a force of not fewer than
3,000,000 men and 160,000 officers in the
field by July 1, 1919. The plan contemplated
having 130,000 officers and
2,168,000 men, or a total of 2,298,000, in
the field and in camps by July 1, 1918,
and approximately an additional million
in the field before June 30, 1919.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker said that all the army camps
and cantonments were to be materially
enlarged, to take care of the training of
the men to be raised in the next twelve
months. The General Staff had this question
under careful consideration, and the
idea was to increase the size of existing
training camps rather than to establish
new camps. These camps, it was estimated,
already had facilities for training
close to a million men at one time.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War also made it
clear that the total of $15,000,000,000 involved
in the estimates as revised for the
new army bill did not cover the whole
cost of the army for the next fiscal year.
The $15,000,000,000, he explained, was
in addition to the large sums that would
be carried in the Fortifications Appropriation
bill, which covers the cost of
heavy ordnance both in the United States
and overseas. Nor did it include the Military
Academy bill. It was emphasized
that, although estimates were submitted
on the basis of an army of a certain size,
Congress was being asked for blanket
authority for the President to raise all
the men needed, and the approximate
figures of $15,000,000,000 could be increased
by deficiency appropriations.</p>

<p>It was brought out in the committee
that the transportation service had improved
and that the War Department was
able to send more men to France each
month. It was estimated that if transport
facilities continued to improve, close to
1,500,000 fighting men would be on the
western front by Dec. 31, 1918. The
United States had now in camp and in
the field, it was explained to the committee,
the following enlisted men and
officers:</p>

<table class="list" summary="United States Soldiers in France">

<p>Provost Marshal General Crowder announced
on May 8 that 1,227,000 Americans
had been called to the colors under
the Selective Draft act, thereby indicating
approximately the strength of the
national army. Additional calls during
May for men to be in camp by June 2
affected something like 366,600 registrants
under the draft law. These men
were largely intended to fill up the camps
at home, replacing the seasoned personnel
from the divisions previously training
there. With the increase of the number
of divisions in France, the flow of replacement
troops was increasing proportionately.</p>

<p>In regard to the number of men in
France, Mr. Baker on May 8 made the
following important announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In January I told the Senate committee
that there was strong likelihood that early
in the present year 500,000 American
troops would be dispatched to France. I
cannot either now or perhaps later discuss
the number of American troops in France,
but I am glad to be able to say that the
forecast I made in January has been surpassed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was the first official utterance
indicating even indirectly the number of
men sent abroad. The first force to go
was never described except as a division,
although as a matter of fact it was constituted
into two divisions soon after its
arrival in France.</p>

<p>An Associated Press dispatch dated
May 17 announced that troops of the
new American Army had arrived within
the zone of the British forces in Northern
France and were completing their
training in the area occupied by the
armies which were blocking the path of
the Germans to the Channel ports. The
British officers who were training the
Americans stated that the men from
overseas were of the finest material.
The newcomers were warmly greeted by
the British troops and were reported to
be full of enthusiasm.

<h2>American Troops in Central France</h2>

<h3>By Laurence Jerrold</h3>

<p class="center small"><i>
This friendly British view of our soldiers
in France is from the pen of a noted war<br />
correspondent of The London Morning Post</i></p>

<p class="drop">I have recently visited the miniature
America now installed in France,
and installed in the most French
part of Central France. There is nothing
more French than these ancient
towns with historic castles, moats, dungeons,
and torture chambers, these old
villages, where farms are sometimes still
battlemented like small castles, and this
countryside where living is easy and
pleasant. On to this heart of France has
descended a whole people from across the
ocean, a people that hails from New
England and California, from Virginia
and Illinois. The American Army has
taken over this heart of France, and is
teaching it to "go some". Townsfolk
and villagers enjoy being taught. The
arrival of the American Army is a revelation
to them.</p>

<p>I was surprised at first to find how
fresh a novelty an allied army was in
this part of France. Then I remembered
that these little towns and villages have
in the last few months for the first time
seen allies of France. The ports where
the American troops land have seen
many other allies; they saw, indeed, in
August, 1914, some of the first British
troops land, whose reception remains in
the recollection of the inhabitants as a
scene of such fervor and loving enthusiasm
as had never been known before
and probably will not be known again.
In fact, to put it brutally, French ports
are blas&eacute;. But this Central France for
the first time welcomes allied troops. It
is true they had seen some Russians, but
the least said of them now the better.
Some of the Russians are still there,
hewing wood for three francs a day per
head, and behaving quite peaceably.</p>

<p>These old towns and villages look upon
the American Army in their midst as
the greatest miracle they have ever
known, and a greater one than they ever
could have dreamed of. One motors
through scores of little towns and villages
where the American soldier, in his
khaki, his soft hat, (which I am told is
soon to be abolished,) and his white gaiters,
swarms. The villagers put up bunting,
calico signs, flags, and have stocks
of American "canned goods" to show in
their shop windows. The children, when
bold, play with the American soldiers, and
the children that are more shy just venture
to go up and touch an American soldier's
leg. Very old peasant ladies put
on their Sunday black and go out walking
and in some mysterious way talking
with American soldiers. The village
Mayor turns out and makes a speech
utterly incomprehensible to the American
soldier, whenever a fresh contingent
of the latter arrives. The 1919 class,
just called up, plays bugles and shouts
"Good morning" when an American car
comes by.</p>

<p>Vice versa, this Central France is perhaps
even more of a miracle to the
American troops than the American
troops are to it. To watch the American
trooper from Arkansas or Chicago being
shown over a castle which is not only
older than the United States, but was in
its prime under Louis XII., and dates
back to a Roman fortress now beneath it,
is a wonderful sight. Here the American
soldier shows himself a charming
child. There is nothing of the "Innocents
Abroad" about him. I heard
scarcely anything (except about telephones
and railways) of any American
brag of modernism in this ancient part
of France. On the contrary, the soldier
is learning with open eyes, and trying to
learn with open ears, all these wonders
of the past among which he has been
suddenly put. The officer, too, even the
educated officer, is beautifully astonished
at all this past, which he had read
about, but which, quite possibly, he didn't
really believe to exist. The American
officers who speak French&mdash;and there
are some of them, coming chiefly from
<a class="pagenum" id="page_416" title="pg 416"> </a>
the Southern States&mdash;are, of course, heroes
in every town, and sought after in
caf&eacute;s at recreation hours by every
French officer and man. Those who do
not know French are learning it, and I
remember a picturesque sight, that of a
very elderly, prim French governess in
black, teaching French to American subalterns
in a Y.M.C.A. canteen.</p>

<p>A great French preacher the other
day, in his sermon in a Paris church,
said that this coming to France of millions
of English troops and future millions
of American troops may mean
eventually one of the greatest changes in
Continental Europe the world has ever
known. His words never seemed to me
so full of meaning as they did when I
was among the Americans in the heart
of France. There, of course, the contrast
is infinitely greater than it can be
in the France which our own troops are
occupying and defending. These young,
fresh, hustling, keen Americans, building
up numerous works of all kinds to
prepare for defending France, have
brought with them Chinese labor and
negro labor; and Chinese and negroes
and German and Austrian prisoners all
work in these American camps under
American officers' orders. Imagine
what an experience, what a miracle, indeed,
this spectacle seems to the country-folk
of this old French soil, who have always
lived very quietly, who never
wanted to go anywhere else, and who
knew, indeed, that France had allies
fighting and working for her, but had
never seen any of them until these
Americans came across three thousand
miles of ocean.</p>

<p>Something of a miracle, also, is what
our new allies are accomplishing. They
are doing everything on a huge scale. I
saw aviation camps, training camps, aviation
schools, vast tracts where barracks
were being put up, railways built, telegraphs
and telephones installed by Chinese
labor, negro labor, German prisoners'
labor, under the direction of American
skilled workmen, who are in France
by the thousand. There are Y.M.C.A.
canteens, Red Cross canteens, clubs for
officers and for men, theatres and cinemas
for the army, and a prodigious
amount of food&mdash;all come from America.
The hams alone I saw strung up in one
canteen would astonish the boches.
American canned goods, meat, fruit, condensed
milk, meal, &amp;c., have arrived in
France in stupendous quantities. No
body of American troops land in France
until what is required for their sustenance
several weeks ahead is already
stored in France. Only the smallest necessaries
are bought on the spot, and
troops passing through England on their
way to France are strictly forbidden,
both officers and men, to buy any article
of food whatsoever in England. As for
the quality, the American has nothing to
complain of, so far as I could see. All
pastry, cakes, sweets are henceforth prohibited
throughout civilian France, but
the American troops rightly have all
these things in plenty. I saw marvelous
cakes and tarts, which would create a
run on any Paris or London teashop, and
the lady who manages one American Red
Cross canteen (by the way, she is an
Englishwoman, and is looked up to by
the American military authorities as one
of the best organizers they have met)
explained to me wonderful recipes they
have for making jam with honey and
preserved fruit. The bread, of course,
they make themselves, and, as is right, it
is pure white flour bread, such as no
civilian knows nowadays.</p>

<p>One motors through scores of villages
and more, and every little old French
spot swarms with American Tommies
billeted in cottages and farmhouses.
Many of them marched straight to their
billets from their landing port, and the
experience is as wonderful for them, just
spirited over from the wilds of America,
as it is for the villagers who welcome
these almost fabulous allies. But it is
the engineering, building, and machinery
works the Americans are putting up
which are the most astonishing. Gangs
of workers have come over in thousands.
Many of these young chaps are college
men, Harvard or Princeton graduates.
They dig and toil as efficiently as any
laborer, and perhaps with more zeal. One
American Major told me with glee how
a party of these young workers arrived
straight from America at 3:30 P. M.,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_417" title="pg 417"> </a>
and started digging at 5 A. M. next
morning. "And they liked it; it tickled
them to death." Many of these drafts,
in fact, were sick and tired of inaction
in ports before their departure from
America, and they welcomed work in
France as if it were some great game.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest work of all the
Americans are doing is a certain aviation
camp and school. In a few months it has
neared completion, and when it is finished
it will, I believe, be the biggest of
its kind in the world. There pilots are
trained, and trained in numbers which I
may not say, but which are comforting.
The number of airplanes they use merely
for training, which also I must not state,
is in itself remarkable. "Training pilots
is the one essential thing," I was told by
the C.O. These flying men&mdash;or boys&mdash;who
have, of course, already been broken
in in America, do an additional course in
France, and when they leave the aviation
camp I saw they are absolutely ready for
air fighting at the front. This is the
finishing school. The aviators go
through eight distinct courses in this
school. They are perfected in flying, in
observation, in bombing, in machine-gun
firing. On even a cloudy and windy day
the air overhead buzzes with these young
American fliers, all getting into the pink
of condition to do their stunts at the
front. They seemed to me as keen as
our own flying men, and as well disciplined.
They live in the camp, and it requires
moving heaven and earth for one
of them to get leave to go even to the
nearest little quiet old town.</p>

<p>The impression is the same of the
American bases in France as of the
American front in France. I found there
and here one distinctive characteristic,
the total absence of bluff. I was never
once told that we were going to be shown
how to win the war. I was never once
told that America is going to win the
war. I never heard that American men
and machines are better than ours, but I
did hear almost apologies from American
soldiers because they had not come into
the war sooner. They are, I believe,
spending now more money than we are&mdash;indeed,
the pay of their officers is about
double that of ours. I said something
about the cost. "Yes, but you see we
must make up for lost time," was all the
American General said. And he told me
about the splendid training work that is
being done now in the States by British
and French officers who have gone out
there knowing what war is, and who
teach American officers and men from
first-hand experience. This particular
General hoped that by this means in a
very short time American troops arriving
in France may be sent much more
quickly to the front than is now the
case.</p>

<p>An impression of complete, businesslike
determination is what one gets when
visiting the Americans in France. A discipline
even stricter than that which applies
in British and French troops is enforced.
In towns, officers, for instance,
are not allowed out after 9 P. M. Some
towns where subalterns discovered the
wine of the country have instantly been
put "out of bounds." No officer, on any
pretext whatsoever, is allowed to go to
Paris, except on official business. From
the camps they are not even allowed to
go to the neighboring towns. They have,
to put it quite frankly, a reputation of
wild Americanism to live down, and they
sometimes surprise the French by their
seriousness. It is a striking sight to see
American officers and men flocking into
tiny little French Protestant churches on
Sundays in this Catholic heart of France.
The congregation is a handful of old
French Huguenots, and the ancient, rigid
French pasteur never in his life preached
to so many, and certainly never to soldiers
from so far. They come from so
far, and from such various parts, these
Americans, and for France, as well as
for themselves, it is a wonderful experience.
I was told that the postal censors
who read the letters of the American expeditionary
force are required to know
forty-seven languages. Of these languages
the two least used are Chinese
and German.

<h2>American Shipbuilders Break All Records</h2>

<h3>Charles M. Schwab Speeds the Work</h3>

<p class="center small">[<span class="smcap">Month Ended May 15, 1918</span>]</p>

<p class="drop">All shipbuilding records have been
broken by American builders in
the last month. On May 14 it
was announced that the first million tons
of ships had been completed and delivered
to the United States Government under
the direction of the Shipping Board.
The actual figures on May 11 showed the
number of ships to be 159, aggregating
1,108,621 tons. More than half of this
tonnage was delivered since Jan. 1, 1918.
Most of these ships were requisitioned on
the ways or in contract form when the
United States entered the war. This result
had been anticipated in the monthly
records, which showed a steady increase
in the tonnage launched:</p>

<table class="list2" summary="Ships Produced for US Government">
<tr>
<td>Month.</td>
<td class="tdr">Number<br /> of Ships<br /> Launched.</td>
<td class="tdr">Aggregate<br /> Tonnage.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>March </td>
<td class="tdr">21</td>
<td class="tdr">166,700</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The rapidity with which ships are
being produced was shown by the breaking
of the world's record on April 20 and
in turn the breaking of this record on
May 5. On the former date the 8,800-ton
steel steamship West Lianga was
launched at Seattle, Wash., fifty-five
working days from the date the keel was
laid. This was then the world's record.
But on May 5 at Camden, N. J., the steel
freight steamship Tuckahoe, of 5,548
tons, was launched twenty-seven days
after the keel was laid.</p>

<p>Ten days after this extraordinary
achievement the Tuckahoe was finished
and furnished and ready for sea&mdash;another
record feat.</p>

<p>Charles M. Schwab, Chairman of the
Board of Directors of the Bethlehem
Steel Corporation, was on April 16, 1918,
appointed Director General of the
Emergency Fleet Corporation to speed up
the Government's shipbuilding program.
He was invested with practically unlimited
powers over all construction work
in shipyards producing vessels for the
Emergency Fleet Corporation. Charles
Piez in consequence ceased to be General
Manager of the Corporation, remaining,
however, as Vice President to supervise
administrative details of construction and
placing contracts.</p>

<p>Mr. Schwab, who was the fifth man to
be put in charge of the shipbuilding
program, was not desirous of accepting
the position when first approached because
he considered his work in producing
steel of first importance in the carrying
out of the nation's war program. But
after a conference with President Wilson,
Edward N. Hurley, Chairman of the
Shipping Board; Bainbridge Colby,
another member of the board, and
Charles Piez, he decided to accept the
new position.</p>

<p>Almost the first thing Mr. Schwab did
was to move his headquarters to Philadelphia
as the centre of the steel-shipbuilding
region, taking with him all the
division chiefs of the Fleet Corporation
directly connected with construction work
and about 2,000 employes. The Shipping
Board and Mr. Piez retained their offices
in Washington with 1,500 subordinates
and employes. As a further step toward
decentralization it was arranged to move
the operating department, including
agencies such as the Interallied Ship Control
Committee, headed by P. A. S. Franklin,
to New York City.</p>

<p>The original "cost-plus" contract
under which the Submarine Boat Corporation
of Newark was to build 160
ships of 5,000 tons for the Government
was canceled by Mr. Schwab as an experiment
to determine whether shipyards
operating under lump-sum contracts and
accepting all responsibility for providing
materials could make greater speed in
construction than those operating with
Government money, such as the Hog
Island yards. The result was to increase
the cost of each of the 160 ships from
$787,500 to $960,000.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_419" title="pg 419"> </a></p>

<p>A request for an appropriation of
$2,223,835,000 for the 1919 program was
presented by Mr. Hurley and Mr. Schwab
to the House Appropriations Committee
on May 8.</p>

<p>Of this total $1,386,100,000 was for
construction of ships and $652,000,000
for the purchasing and requisitioning of
plants and material in connection with
the building program.</p>

<h2>Third Liberty Loan Oversubscribed</h2>

<h3>Approximately 17,000,000 Buyers</h3>

<p class="drop">When the Third Liberty Loan,
raised to finance America's
war needs, closed on May 4,
1918, the subscriptions were
well over $4,000,000,000, a billion in excess
of the amount called for. The total
was announced on May 17 as $4,170,019,650.
Secretary McAdoo stated that he
would allot bonds in full on all subscriptions.</p>

<p>The loan was regarded as the most
successful ever floated by any nation,
not so much because of the volume of
sales, but because of the wide distribution
of the loan. Approximately 17,000,000
individuals subscribed, that is, about
one person in every six in the United
States. The number of buyers in the
Third Loan exceeded those in the Second
by 7,000,000 and those in the First by
12,500,000.</p>

<p>The campaign throughout the country
was conducted with all the thoroughness
of a great political struggle, with the
difference that there were no contending
parties and all forces were marshaled
to make the loan a success. Nor was the
campaign merely a display of efficient
organization and vigorous propaganda.
It had many features of dramatic and
picturesque interest, not only in the large
cities, but in almost every smaller centre
of the nation. A noonday rally of
50,000 men and women in Wall Street,
New York, on the closing day, was typical.
An eyewitness described it thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Police Department Band appeared
and the band of the 15th Coast Artillery
from Fort Hamilton. Taking advantage
of the occasion, James Montgomery Flagg
now appeared in his studio van on the
southern fringe of the Broad Street crowd.
A girl with him played something on the
cornet. It was a good deal like a show
on the Midway at a Western county fair.
But this was no faker&mdash;one of the most
famous artists in America, throwing in
a signed sketch of whoever bought Liberty
bonds. Those near him began pushing
and crowding to take advantage of
the offer.</p>

<p>And now, suddenly, a tremendous racket
up the street toward Broadway. Who
comes?</p>

<p>Cheer on cheer, now. It is the "Anzacs."
Twelve long, rangy fellows, officers all,
six or seven of them with the little brass
"A" on the shoulder, which signifies
service at Gallipoli and in Flanders. They
are members of the contingent of 500
which arrived here yesterday on its way
to the battlefields of France. They run
lightly up the Sub-Treasury steps and
take their stand in a group beside the
soldier band.</p>

<p>And now they all come&mdash;all the actors
in the drama of the day. Governor Whitman,
bareheaded, solemn-faced; Rabbi
Stephen Wise, with his rugged face and
his shock of blue-black hair; Mme. Schumann-Heink,
panting a little with excitement;
Auguste Bouilliz, baritone of the
Royal Opera of Brussels, who later is to
thrill them all with his singing of the
"Marseillaise"; Cecil Arden, in a shining
helmet and draped in the Union Jack,
come to sing "God Save the King," while
the sunburned Australian officers stand
like statues at salute; Oscar Straus, and
then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yee-ee-ee-eee."</p>

<p>Oh, how they cheered! For the "Blue
Devils" of France had poured out of the
door of the Sub-Treasury and, with the
fitful sun shining once more and gleaming
on their bayonets, were running down
the steps in two lines, past the "Anzacs,"
past the soldier band, to draw up in ranks
at the bottom.</p>

<p>Lieutenant de Moal speaks. What does
he say? Who knows? But he is widely
cheered, just the same, as he gives way
to Governor Whitman.</p>

<p>"There are gatherings like this, though
not so large, all over our land today,"
cries the Governor. "In every town and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_420" title="pg 420"> </a>
city we Americans are gathered together
at this moment to demonstrate that we
are behind our army, behind our navy,
behind our President."</p>

<p>The cheers that acclaimed his mention
of the President drowned his voice for
several moments.</p>

<p>"Here are the Australians," he cries,
pointing to the "Anzac" officers. "They
have brought us a message, but we are
going to give them a message, too."</p>

<p>As the Governor stepped back to cheers
that rocked the street, Lieutenant de Moal
barked a sharp order, and the "Blue
Devils" shouldered their guns with fixed
bayonets, the six trumpeters ta-ra-ta-raed,
and the soldiers of France moved
off up the sidewalk lane to the side door
of the Stock Exchange, where all business
was suspended during the fifteen minutes
of their visit on the floor.</p>

<p>Four of the "Anzacs" meanwhile were
taken from their ranks on the steps of
the building up to the pedestal of the
statue of Washington, which was used as
speaker's platform, and Captain Frank
McCallam made a brief address.</p>

<p>"We haven't many men left," he said
simply. "And it is up to you people to
help us out to the best of your ability."</p>

<p>More cheers, and then Cecil Arden sang
"God Save the King." The American
regular fired a blank volley over
the heads of the crowd, and the kids
scrambled for the empty shells.</p>

<p>Following Wise and Straus, Bouilliz, the
Belgian baritone, sang the "Marseillaise,"
and then, after the soldier band had
played "Where Do We Go from Here,
Boys?" Mme. Schumann-Heink advanced
and sang the national anthem, following
it up with an appeal that was the climax
to the play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Less exciting but more impressive was
the parade on April 26, when thousands
of mothers who had sent their sons to
the front marched in a column of 35,000
men and women in the Liberty Day
parade in New York City. This day had
been proclaimed as such by President
Wilson for "the people of the United
States to assemble in their respective
communities and liberally pledge anew
their financial support to sustain the
nation's cause, and to hold patriotic demonstrations
in every city, town, and
hamlet throughout the land."</p>

<p>The challenge of the mothers was inscribed
on one of the banners they carried:
"We give our sons&mdash;they give their
lives&mdash;what do you give?"</p>

<p>Remarkable as was the appearance of
these mothers with the little service
flags over their shoulders, many of them
so old that they marched with difficulty,
the spectators who flanked the line of
march along Fifth Avenue from Washington
Square to Fifty-ninth Street
found it even more thrilling to note that
so very many of them, whether they
were mothers or young wives, or just
young girls proud of the brothers that
had gone forth to service&mdash;so very many
of them carried service flags with three
and four and five and even six stars, and
occasionally a glint of the sun would even
carry the eye to a gold star, which meant,
whenever it appeared, a veil of mourning
for a wooden cross somewhere in France.</p>

<p>Among the minor but ingenious forms
of publicity was the Liberty Loan ball
which was rolled from Buffalo to New
York, a distance of 470 miles, and which
ended its journey of three weeks on May
4 at the City Hall. The ball was a large
steel shell covered with canvas.</p>

<p>Every community that reached or exceeded
its quota to the loan was entitled
to raise a flag of honor specially designed
for the purpose. At least 32,000 communities
gained the honor and raised the
flag.</p>

<p>To strengthen the financial basis of
the nation's war industries and use
monetary resources to the best advantage
the War Finance Corporation bill
was passed by Congress and approved
by President Wilson on April 5, 1918.
The two main purposes of the act are to
provide credits for industries and enterprises
necessary or contributory to the
prosecution of the war and to supervise
new issues of capital. The act creates
the War Finance Corporation, consisting
of the Secretary and four additional persons,
with $500,000,000 capital stock, all
subscribed by the United States. Banks
and trust companies financing war industries
or enterprises may receive advances
from the corporation.</p>

<h2>Former War Loans of the United States</h2>

<h3>A Historical Retrospect</h3>

<p><i>The United States Government asked for $2,000,000,000 on the First Liberty Loan
in the Spring of 1917, and $3,034,000,000 was subscribed by over 4,000,000 subscribers.
For the Second Loan, near the end of 1917, $3,000,000,000 was sought, and
$4,617,532,300 was subscribed by 9,420,000 subscribers.</i></p>

<p><i>The Guaranty Trust Company of New York in a recent brochure reviewed the
history of the various war loans of the United States, beginning with the Revolutionary
loans, as follows:</i></p>

<p class="drop">When the patriots at Lexington
"fired the shot heard 'round the
world," the thirteen Colonies found
themselves suddenly in the midst of war,
but with practically no funds in their
Treasuries. The Continental Congress
was without power to raise money by
taxation, and had to depend upon credit
bills and requisitions drawn against the
several Colonies. France was the first
foreign country to come to the aid of
struggling America, the King of France
himself advancing us our first loan. All
told, France's loan was $6,352,500; Holland
loaned us $1,304,000; and Spain
assisted us with $174,017. Our loan from
France was repaid between 1791 and 1795
to the Revolutionary Government of
France; the Holland loan during the
same period in five annual installments,
and the Spanish loan in 1792-3.</p>

<p>Our first domestic war loan of &pound;6,000
was made in 1775, and the loan was taken
at par. A year and a half later found
Congress laboring under unusual difficulties.
Boston and New York were held
by the enemy, the patriot forces were
retreating, and the people were as little
inclined to submit to domestic taxation
as they had formerly been to "taxation
without representation." To raise funds
even a lottery was attempted. In
October, 1776, Congress authorized a
second loan for $5,000,000. It was not a
pronounced success, only $3,787,000 being
raised in twelve months. In 1778 fourteen
issues of paper money were authorized
as the only way to meet the expenses
of the army. By the end of the year 1779
Congress had issued $200,000,000 in paper
money, while a like amount had been
issued by the several States. In 1781, as
a result of this financing and of the
general situation, Continental bills of
credit had fallen 99 per cent.</p>

<p>Then came Robert Morris, that genius
of finance, who found ways to raise the
money which assured the triumph of the
American cause. By straining his personal
credit, which was higher than that
of the Government, he borrowed upon
his own individual security on every
hand. On one occasion he borrowed from
the commander of the French fleet,
securing the latter with his personal
obligation. If Morris and other patriotic
citizens had not rendered such assistance
to the Government, some of the most
important campaigns of the Revolutionary
War would have been impossible. Following
came the Bank of Pennsylvania,
which issued its notes&mdash;in effect, loans&mdash;to
provide rations and equipment for
Washington's army at Valley Forge.
These notes were secured by bills of exchange
drawn against our envoys abroad,
but it was never seriously intended that
they should be presented for payment.
The bank was a tremendous success in
securing the money necessary to carry
out its patriotic purposes, and was practically
the first bank of issue in this country.</p>

<p>With the actual establishment of the
United States and the adoption of the
Constitution, Alexander Hamilton came
forward with a funding scheme by which
the various debts owed to foreign countries,
to private creditors, and to the
several States were combined. In 1791,
on a specie basis, our total debt was
$75,000,000. The paper dollar was practically
valueless and the people were
forced to give the Government adequate
powers to raise money and to impose
taxes. Between that date and 1812
<a class="pagenum" id="page_422" title="pg 422"> </a>
thirteen tariff bills were passed to raise
money to meet public expenditures and
pay off the national debt.</p>

<h3>THE WAR OF 1812.</h3>

<p>For some time previous to the actual
outbreak of the War of 1812 hostilities
had been predicted. In a measure, this
enabled Congress to prepare for it. And
although the war did not begin until
June of 1812, as early as March of that
year a loan of $11,000,000, bearing 6 per
cent. at par, to be paid off within 12
years from the beginning of 1813, was
authorized. Of this, however, only $2,150,000
was issued, and all was redeemed
by 1817. The next year a loan of $16,000,000
was authorized and subscribed.
This was followed, in August, by a loan
of $7,500,000 which sold at 88-1/4 per
cent.</p>

<p>At the end of the war the total loans
negotiated by the Government aggregated
$88,000,000. The nation's public debt, as
a result of this war, was increased to
$127,334,933 in 1816. By 1835, either by
redemptions or maturity, it was all paid.</p>

<h3>MEXICAN WAR LOANS</h3>

<p>The Mexican War net debt incurred
by the United States was approximately
$49,000,000 and was financed by loans
in the form of Treasury notes and Government
stock. The Treasury notes, under
the act of 1846, totaled $7,687,800 and
the stock $4,999,149. The latter paid 6
per cent. interest. By act of 1847 Treasury
notes to the amount of $26,122,100
were issued, bearing interest in the discretion
of the Secretary of the Treasury,
reimbursable one and two years
after date, and convertible into United
States stock at 6 per cent. They were
redeemable after Dec. 31, 1867. Economic
developments following this war
led to a period of extraordinary industrial
prosperity which lasted for several years.
A change in the fiscal policy of the Government,
with overexpansion of industry,
however, resulted in a panic in 1857 and
a Treasury deficit in 1858. The debt
contracted in consequence of the Mexican
War was redeemed in full by 1874.</p>

<p>The situation had not improved to any
great extent when Lincoln took office
on March 4, 1861, and by mid-November
of that year a panic was in full swing.
The outbreak of the civil war found the
Treasury empty and the financial machinery
of the Government seriously disorganized.
Public credit was low, the
public mind was disturbed, and raising
money was difficult. In 1862 the Legal
Tender act was passed, authorizing an
issue of $150,000,000 of legal-tender
notes, and an issue of bonds in the
amount of $500,000,000 was authorized.</p>

<p>This proved to be a most popular loan.
The bonds were subject to redemption
after five years and were payable in
twenty years. They bore interest at 6
per cent., payable semi-annually, and
were issued in denominations of $50, $100,
$500, and $1,000. Through one agent,
Jay Cooke, a genius at distribution, who
employed 2,850 sub-agents and advertised
extensively, this loan was placed directly
with the people at par in currency. Altogether
the aggregate of this loan was
$514,771,600. Later in that year Congress
authorized a second issue of Treasury
notes in the amount of $150,000,000 at
par, with interest at 6 per cent.; in January,
1863, a third issue of $100,000,000
was authorized, which was increased in
March to $150,000,000, at 5 per cent.
interest. These issues were referred to
as the "one and two year issues of
1863."</p>

<h3>DEFICIT IN 1862</h3>

<p>In December, 1862, Congress had to
face a deficit of $277,000,000 and unpaid
requisitions amounting to $47,000,000.
By the close of 1863 nearly $400,000,000
had been raised by bond sales. A further
loan act, passed March 3, 1864, provided
for an issue of $200,000,000 of 5 per
cent. bonds known as "ten-fortys," but
of this total only $73,337,000 was disposed
of. Subsequently, on June 30, 1864,
a great public loan of $200,000,000 was
authorized. This was an issue of Treasury
notes, payable at any time not exceeding
three years, and bearing interest
at 7-3/10 per cent. Notes amounting to
$828,800,000 were sold. The aggregate
of Government loans during the civil war
footed up a total of $2,600,700,000; and
on Sept. 1, 1865, the public debt closely
<a class="pagenum" id="page_423" title="pg 423"> </a>
approached $3,000,000,000, less than one-half
of which was funded.</p>

<p>Civil war loans, with one exception,
which sold at 89-3/10, were all placed at
par in currency, subject to commissions
ranging from an eighth to one per cent.
to distributing bankers. The average
interest nominally paid by the Government
on its bonds during the war was
slightly under 6 per cent. Owing to payment
being made in currency, however,
the rate was, in reality, much higher.
With the conclusion of the war, the reduction
of the public debt was undertaken,
and it has continued with but
two interruptions to date.</p>

<p>Heavy tax receipts for several years
after the close of the war potentially
enabled the Government to reduce its
debt. Indeed, from 1866 to 1891, each
year's ordinary receipts exceeded disbursements,
and enabled the Government
to lighten its financial burdens. In 1866
the decrease in the net debt was $120,395,408;
in 1867, $127,884,952; in 1868,
$27,297,798; in 1869, $48,081,540; in 1870,
$101,601,917; in 1871, $84,175,888; in
1872, $97,213,538, and in 1873, $44,318,470.</p>

<p>Through refunding operations&mdash;in addition
to bonds and short-time obligations
redeemed with surplus revenues&mdash;the
Government paid off, up to 1879, $535,000,000
bonds bearing interest at from
5 to 6 per cent. In this year the credit
of the Government was on a 4 per cent.
basis, and a year later on a 3-1/4 per
cent. basis, against a maximum basis of
15-1/2 per cent. in 1864.</p>

<p>Between 1881 and 1887 the Government
paid off, either with surplus revenues
or by conversion, $618,000,000 of
interest-bearing debt. In 1891 all bonds
then redeemable were retired, and on
July 1, 1893, the public debt amounted
to less than one-third of the maximum
outstanding in 1865. In 1900 the Government
converted $445,900,000 bonds out of
an aggregate of $839,000,000 convertible
under the refunding act passed by Congress
in that year. And further conversions
in 1903, 1905, and 1907 brought
the grand total up to $647,250,150&mdash;a
result which earned for the Government
a net annual saving in interest account
of $16,551,037.</p>

<h3>SPANISH WAR LOANS</h3>

<p>The United States is a debt-paying
nation. Hence, America's credit, despite
occasional fluctuations, has steadily risen,
and our national debt has sold on a lower
income basis than that of any other
nation in the world.</p>

<p>Following the sinking of the Maine
in Havana Harbor, in 1898, Congress
authorized an issue of $200,000,000 3
per cent. ten-twenty-year bonds. Of this
aggregate $198,792,660 were sold by the
Government at par. So popular was this
loan, it was oversubscribed seven times.
During the year 1898, following the allotment
to the public, this issue sold at
a premium, the price going to 107-3/4,
and, during the next year, to 110-3/4.
After the war ended, the Government,
in accordance with its unvarying custom,
began to pay off this debt; but, despite
the Secretary of the Treasury's offer to
buy these bonds, he succeeded in purchasing
only about $20,000,000 of them.</p>

<h2>American Labor Mission in Europe</h2>

<h3>War Aims of Organized Workers Conveyed to
English and French Labor Unions</h3>

<p class="drop">An American Labor Mission visited
England and France in April,
1918, to present the views of
American workingmen regarding
the war.  The delegation numbered
eighteen, headed by James Wilson, President
of the Patternmakers' League of
North America. In his first address at
London, April 28, before the British and
Foreign Press Association, Mr. Wilson
said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We recognize as a fundamental truth
that there can be no democracy with the
triumph of the Imperial German Government.
The principle of democracy or the
principle of Prussian military autocracy
will prevail as a result of the world war.
There can be no middle course nor compromise.
The contest must be carried on
to its finality.</p>

<p>The Central Powers have staked everything
on the result of this struggle. Their
defeat means the destruction of a machine
which has been built with remarkable
efficiency and embodies the very life of
the German race.</p>

<p>On the other hand, every free man instinctively
appreciates that if we are to
maintain the standard of civilization as
worked out by the free men of the world,
and if posterity is to be guaranteed political
and industrial freedom, the war must
be won by the allied countries. Peace now
would be the fulfillment of the Prussian
dream, for they have within their grasp
the very heart of Continental Europe and
resources which would make sure further
conquest upon the other nations of the
world.</p>

<p>The American labor movement, in whose
behalf my colleagues and myself have
been authorized to speak, declare most
emphatically that they will not agree to
a peace conference with the enemies of
civilization, irrespective of what cloak
they wear, until Prussian militarism has
withdrawn within its own boundaries, and
then not until the Germans have, through
proper representatives, proved to our satisfaction
that they recognize the right of
peoples and civilized nations to determine
for themselves what shall be their
standard.</p>

<p>Unless reconstruction shall soon come
from the German workers within that
country, it is now plain that the opportunity
to uproot the agencies of force will
only come when democracy has defeated
autocracy in the military field and wins
the right to reconstruct the relations between
nations and men.</p>

<p>German freedom is ultimately the problem
of the German people, but the defeat
of Prussian autocracy in the field will
bring the opportunity for German liberty
at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>BRITISH SEAMEN'S ATTITUDE</h3>

<p>J. Havelock Wilson, President of the
British Seamen's Union, conferred with
the American Mission at London, April
30, and informed it of the decision of his
union to transport no pacifists to any
peace conference. He made the following
statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Sept. 21, 1917, we formed what we
called a Merchant Seamen's League, and
declared that if German terrorism on the
sea continued we would enforce a boycott
against Germany for two years after
the war, and that for every new crime
from that time on we would add one
month to the length of the boycott. The
length of the boycott now stands at five
years seven months. We have reliable
information that this action is making a
very profound impression on German
manufacturers and shippers.</p>

<p>The British seamen got their first intimation
of German treachery when the
international transport strike was first
proposed by German delegates ostensibly
to pledge support. But the British learned
later that the German delegates had in
their pockets as they talked contracts
signed with employers.</p>

<p>After that we watched the German Social
Democrats in the Socialists' international.
But we never could get the
Germans to face the issue. Always they
had excuses and evasions. We never had
confidence in them. When war came we
felt it our duty to take care of the men
on our ships who could no longer sail,
and also to set a good example.</p>

<p>Here were Germans on our ships who
had been in England so long that they
had forgotten their language. On Aug.
20, 1914&mdash;you see we acted quickly&mdash;we
bought an estate of thirty-nine acres and
built the model internment camp of Great
Britain. We asked the Government to
give us charge of all interned German
sailors, and, let it be known to the credit
of Great Britain, that was done. The
<a class="pagenum" id="page_425" title="pg 425"> </a>
Government allowed us all 10s. per week
per man for upkeep. The camp became
a great success. There were 1,000 German
sailors interned in it.</p>

<p>Until May, 1915, all went well. On May
1 the interned men celebrated May Day,
their international revolutionary holiday.
They had their banners, "Workers of the
World, Unite," "World Brotherhood,"
and so on. We had planned a great f&ecirc;te
to be held later and I had secured the consent
of several well-known persons to attend
and help make it a success. On May
7 the Lusitania was sunk. I called the
Germans in camp together and told them
the terrible thing that had happened. I
told them they were not to blame, but that
the celebration could not be held. And
they made no protest to me.</p>

<p>Now here were 1,000 Germans not under
control of the Kaiser. Some of them had
been among us twenty or thirty years.
As soon as I had got out of the place
they sang and cheered and rejoiced over
the Lusitania disaster. They kept this up
for four hours. They made me conclude
that the camp must be handed over to the
military as soon as possible, and this was
done. Six months after that came the
U-boat campaign, and, what made that
worse, the fact that the U-boats always
turned their guns on open boats.</p>

<p>I have got hundreds of cases of boys
whose arms and legs have been blown off
by U-boat guns while trying to get away
from sinking ships in open boats. I wrote
the Secretary of the International Transport
Workers' Union protesting against
these crimes. His reply attempted to
justify every crime. That showed us that
not only was the Kaiser responsible, but
that the organized trade union movement
of Germany was also responsible.</p>

<p>On June 1, 1917, a Socialist congress
was convened at Leeds. It was advertised
as the greatest conference ever held.
We sent two men there to tell our story.
Our men found that small bodies of only
a handful of members had been delegated,
who got the floor easily for the pacifist
cause. Our men could not secure anything
like a fair chance.</p>

<p>In this conference MacDonald, Fairchild,
and Jowett were elected delegates to
Stockholm. We at once resolved that no
delegates should leave this country. And
none did.</p>

<p>That is the history of the seamen's determination
to bottle up such British pacifists
as may desire to go abroad spreading
their doctrine. Mingled with it is the
grim, sad story of 12,000 members of the
Seamen's Union who have lost their lives
on merchant ships through Germany's
criminal conduct on the seas.</p>

<p>And while there is here and there one
in England who resembles a leader of
labor who is a pacifist, the determination
of the British seamen to go through with
the war to the finish is scarcely more
than a reflection of the rank-and-file
spirit that is to be found throughout the
whole of British labor.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>NO PARLEYS WITH ENEMY LABOR</h3>

<p>The American delegates met the representatives
of labor in London and in
Paris. In England they found the sentiment
almost unanimous in approval of
their decision to favor no conferences
with German labor representatives until
a victory had been achieved. In France,
however, they encountered a group that
favored contact with the German and
Austrian Socialists. On May 6 there
was a conference in Paris between the
American labor delegates and the members
of the Confederation G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de
Travail, the great French revolutionary
labor organization. M. Jouhaux, General
Secretary of the confederation, made
the proposed international conference
practically the sole note of his speech.
France, he asserted, had no hatred for
the German workers themselves, and he
pointed out that if the conference took
place it could have only one of two results.
Either the workers in the enemy
countries would refuse to join in the efforts
of the workers of the allied countries
for the liberation of the world's peoples,
in which case the war must continue,
or they would accept the allied
view of what was right and would act
with the allied peoples for the good of
humanity.</p>

<p>The American reply was in these definite
words:</p>

<p>"We don't hate the German workers
any more than you do, but to give them
our hand now would be looked upon by
them only as a sign of weakness."</p>

<p>After reminding the congress of the
hypocritical professions of the German
Socialist Party before the war, the delegation
declared itself in entire agreement
with Samuel Gompers that American
labor men would refuse to meet the German
delegates under any circumstances
so long as Germany was ruled by an Imperialistic
Government. This declaration
left Albert Thomas, former Cabinet officer
and leader of the group, practically
<a class="pagenum" id="page_426" title="pg 426"> </a>
without a word to say. M. Thomas
urged the same arguments as Jouhaux,
but all the satisfaction the French labor
men got was a promise from James Wilson,
President of the American delegation,
to report the matter to the American
workers when he returned home.</p>

<p>Chairman Wilson reaffirmed at a
luncheon given at the Foreign Office
May 10 that American labor would not
discuss the war with representatives of
German labor until victory was won, because
German labor, which was permitting
the war, must do something itself
in its own country toward ending
the conflict justly before it could debate
with labor representatives of the allied
countries on what ought to be.</p>

<p>The luncheon was given by Stephen
Pichon, Foreign Minister, on behalf of
the French Government. With the exception
of Premier Clemenceau, all the
members of the Cabinet were present as
well as other men notable in French
public life. Ambassador Sharp was also
in attendance.</p>

<p>The mission visited the fighting front
and returned to London May 11 to hold
mass meetings at English industrial centres.
The members were received by the
King and dined by the London Chamber
of Commerce May 15.</p>

sunk by the Allies was greater than Germany's
output.</p>

On the same day diplomatic representatives
of the allied powers were formally
informed by the Siberian Provincial
Duma of the formation&mdash;by representatives

and the investigation of their alleged
participation in negotiations said

Peking embassies and the Siberian Autonomous
Government. He also asked them
to explain their attitude toward the Soviet
Government and the alleged attempts of
their representatives to interfere with the
internal life of Russia. Japan was asked
to explain the participation of Japanese
officials in the counter-revolutionary
movement. An official report of the demand
for the removal of John K. Caldwell,
the American Consul at Vladivostok,

<p class="hang">The German advance into the Ukraine continued,
military rule was established in
Kiev, and several members of the Government,
including the Minister of War, were
removed on the ground that the Government
had proved too weak to maintain
law and order. Vice Chancellor von
Payer, speaking before the Main Committee
of the German Reichstag on May 4,
attempted to justify Germany's use of the
iron hand by declaring that grain had
been withheld and that prominent Ukrainians,
members of the Committee of
Safety, had been caught planning the assassination
of German officers.</p>

<p class="hang">Rostov-on-the-Don was occupied by Germans
on May 9, but was recaptured by

message to Ambassador Joffe, at Berlin,
instructing him to try to obtain from
Berlin cessation of every kind of hostility,
and declared that captures of Russian
territory violated the terms of the treaty
of peace. He also gave assurances that
the Black Sea Fleet would not attack
the port of Novorossysk, which the Germans
threatened to capture. In an
evasive reply the Commander in Chief of
the German troops in the East said he
could only agree to the cessation of naval
operations against the Black Sea Fleet,
provided that all ships returned to Sebastopol
and were retained there, thus leaving
the port of Novorossysk free for navigation.</p>

<p class="hang">A Swedish report of May 14 told of a German
ultimatum to the Bolshevist Government
demanding the occupation of Moscow
and other Russian cities, the abolishment
of armaments, and the effecting of
certain financial measures which would
practically make Russia a German colony.</p>

<p class="hang">Hostilities between the Finnish White Guards
and the Germans and the Red Guards continued.
Germany protested to the Bolshevist
Foreign Minister on April 23
against the landing of allied troops at
Murmansk, declaring that such landing
was a violation of the Brest-Litovsk
treaty. Germany also denied that Germans
had participated in the raid of the
Finnish White Guards upon Kem.</p>

<p class="hang">The White Guards, on April 26, demanded the
surrender of a fort on the Finnish coast
ceded to Russia by the Finnish Bolshevist
Government, constituting part of the
Kronstadt defenses. The Kronstadt Council
of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates
refused to comply with the demand, and
organized resistance.</p>

<p class="hang">Viborg was taken by the White Guards on
April 30. On May 3, the Germans in the

Austria.</p>

Maurice, formerly Director General of British
Military Operations, addressed a letter
to The London Daily Chronicle challenging
the statements made in the House of
Commons by Premier Lloyd George and
Andrew Bonar Law with regard to the
military situation and demanding a Parliamentary
investigation. On May 7 ex-Premier
Asquith moved for an inquiry in
Commons. After a speech by Lloyd
George in Commons in his own defense,
May 9, the House, by a vote of 293 to 106,
upheld him and the Government and rejected
Mr. Asquith's motion.</p>

<p class="hang">The Austrian Premier was empowered by
Emperor Charles, on May 4, to adjourn
Parliament and to inaugurate measures to
render impossible the resumption of its
activities.</p>

<p class="hang">A growing resentment against the domination
of Austria-Hungary by Germany was
manifested by Austria's Slavic peoples. A
dispatch from Switzerland dated May 8
told of serious disturbances in the fleet,
caused by seamen of Slavic and Italian
stock, which resulted in several changes
in the high command. A new Hungarian
Cabinet, headed by Dr. Wekerle, was
formed on May 10. On May 13 Vienna
papers published a declaration by the
Czech members of the Austrian House of
Lords in which an independent State was
demanded.</p>

<p class="hang">As a result of a conference between Emperor
William and Emperor Charles at German
Headquarters on May 10, Austria-Hungary
concluded a new convention with Germany.</p>

<p class="hang">M. Duval, manager of the Bonnet Rouge, and
his associates, Leymarie and Marion,
directors of the paper; Goldsky and Landau,
journalists, and two minor men
named Joucla and Vercasson, were placed
on trial in Paris on charges of treason
and espionage, on April 29. On May 15,
Duval was sentenced to death for treason,
and the six other defendants were sentenced
to imprisonment for terms ranging
from two to ten years.</p>

<p class="hang">The British Government replied to the note
of the Netherlands Government concerning
the taking over of Dutch ships on
May 1, and asserted the full legality of
the seizure.</p>

<p class="hang">A London dispatch, dated April 24, announced
that Germany had sent an ultimatum
to Holland demanding the right
of transit for civilian supplies and sand
and gravel. Holland yielded to these
demands on April 28, with the stipulation
that the sand and gravel should not be
used for war purposes. On May 5, Foreign
Minister Loudon announced in the
Dutch Chamber that Germany had promised
to transport no troops or military
supplies and to limit the amount of sand
and gravel.</p>

<p class="hang">Persia informed Holland, on May 3, that it
regarded as null and void all treaties
imposed upon Persia in recent years, and
especially the Russo-British treaty of
1907 regarding the spheres of influence.</p>

<h2>German Losses On All Fronts</h2>

<h3>One Estimate Reaches 5,600,000</h3>

<p class="drop">Karl Bleibtreu, the German
military statistician, writing in
Das Neue Europa of April 22,
gives the German losses from Aug. 2,
1914, to Jan. 31, 1918, as 4,456,961 men.
His figures deal exclusively with those
killed in action or taken prisoner. They

31, 1917, and are then estimated to Jan.
31, 1918. His figures and comment read:</p>

<p>From Aug. 1, 1917, to Jan. 31, 1918,
Herr Bleibtreu estimates the total losses

4,456,961 men.</p>

<p>In adding those who died from illness
or wounds, the losses resulting from the
colonial and maritime fighting, as well as
in the noncombatant and auxiliary services,
not comprised in the preceding
enumeration, the grand total considerably
exceeds 5,000,000.</p>

<p>Estimates of German losses from Jan.
31, 1918, to May 20, 1918, range from
400,000 to 600,000. If the above figures
are correct, the total German loss in the
forty-six months of the war exceeds
5,600,000. The London Telegraph, in
analyzing these figures, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With regard to the figures given by
Herr Bleibtreu, it may be remarked that
they are enormously in excess over those
compiled in well-informed quarters from
the official casualty lists published by the
German Government, and issued periodically.
Down to July 31, 1918, these lists
had contained a grand total of 4,624,256
names, but did not include naval or
Colonial troop losses. Of the above figure
the following are the permanent losses:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These statistics are merely the names
published down to July 31, 1917, and are
not to be taken as the actual total casualties,
as the lists are always at least
several weeks behindhand. But even allowing
for this fact, Bleibtreu's estimate
for the killed in action and prisoners
alone is considerably more than double
those officially acknowledged by Berlin,
and nearly equal to the total casualties
admitted in the official lists from all
causes. Of this remarkable discrepancy
there can be only two possible explanations.
Either the German Government
has throughout the war systematically
falsified its casualty lists&mdash;and there is
good reason to believe that this is the
case&mdash;or else Bleibtreu has been put up
by the German Staff to publish a set of
statistics intended deliberately to mislead
the Allies.

<h2>Great Britain's Finances</h2>

<h3>Heavy War Taxes Levied</h3>

<p class="drop">The new British budget for 1918-19
was introduced in the House of
Commons April 23. It included
some sweeping changes in taxes
and gave important data of expenses.
The estimate for 1918 in round numbers
is $15,000,000,000; the estimated revenue
is $4,200,000,000, leaving a balance to be
covered by loans of $10,800,000,000. The
actual expenditures in 1917-18 were
$13,481,105,000; the revenue was $3,536,175,000;
the deficit met by loans was
$9,944,930,000.</p>

<p>Under the new budget the tax on incomes
is increased from $1.25 in $5 to
$1.50 in $5. Under the new rate the
increased tax begins at an income of
$2,500 a year. On an income that is
wholly earned&mdash;such as a salary&mdash;the
tax is as follows:</p>

paid on the following incomes, including
income tax and super tax, are as follows:</p>

<p>The tax on $500,000 incomes is a little
over 50 per cent. In the case of a tax-payer
whose total income does not exceed
$4,000 an allowance of $125 is granted
in respect of his wife and an allowance
of a like amount in respect of any dependent
relatives whom he maintains;
also an allowance of $125 in respect of
children under 16 years of age.</p>

<h3>TAXES ON COMMODITIES</h3>

<p>Checks require a stamp of 4 cents, also
promissory notes. The excess-profit
rate remains at 80 per cent. The tax on
spirits is raised to $7.50 a gallon; on
beer to $12.50 a barrel; on tobacco to
$2.04 a pound, the effect of which will
increase the price 4 cents an ounce,
while the cheapest cigarette, now 6 cents
for ten, will be 7 cents for ten. The tax
on matches is increased so that they will
be sold at 2 cents a box instead of 1-1/2
cents. An additional duty of $3 a hundredweight
is levied on sugar, so that
sugar heretofore selling at 11-1/2 cents a
pound will now have to be sold at 14
cents a pound.</p>

<p>A tax of 16-2/3 per cent, is levied on
the sale of luxuries, including jewelry,
and of articles above a certain price when
they become articles of luxury; also on
hotel and restaurant bills. This tax will
be collected by means of stamps. The
new postage rate is raised to 3 cents an
ounce; on book packages exceeding one
ounce an extra charge of 1 cent will be
levied. Letters to the United States will
cost 3 cents instead of 2 cents. Post-cards
in England will be 2 cents instead
of 1 cent, and the parcel rate, under
seven pounds, 18 cents, and between
seven and eleven pounds, 25 cents.</p>

<h3>LUXURIES HEAVILY TAXED</h3>

<p>The tax on luxuries is a new tax in
England, and is following the method
adopted in France Dec. 31, 1917. The
tax on luxuries in France is levied at
the rate of 10 per cent. on the retail
selling price of the scheduled articles.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_433" title="pg 433"> </a>
All payments of less than 20 cents are
exempted. The schedule consists of two
lists, one comprising articles taxed irrespective
of price at 10 per cent., and the
other, articles taxed when the retail
price exceeds certain specified amounts,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Taxed Irrespective of Price.</i>&mdash;Photographic
appliances, gold or platinum
jewelry, billiard tables, silk hosiery and
underwear, artistic bronze and iron work,
horses and ponies for pleasure purposes,
curiosities and antiques, sporting guns,
books, servants' liveries, gold watches,
perfumery, soaps and dentifrices, paintings
and sculpture, pianos, (other than
cottage pianos,) tapestry, truffles, pleasure
boats, and yachts.</p>

<p><i>Taxed Above Specified Prices, (approximately
shown in U.S. money.)</i>&mdash;Pet
dogs, $8; other pets, $2; smokers' requisites,
$2; bicycles, $50; silver jewelry, $2;
picture frames, $2; walking sticks, $2;
chinaware table service, $40; single pieces,
39c to $3; men's headwear, $4; women's
hats, $8; women's footwear, $8; men's
footwear, $10; chocolates, 75c per pound;
corsets, $10; men's suits, $35; women's
costumes or mantles, $50; scissors, $2;
lace and embroidery machine made, 35c
per yard; handmade, $1.83 per yard;
artificial flowers, $2; furs, $20; gloves,
$1.58; furniture, $300 per suite; mirrors,
$4; motor cycles, $400; watches, $10; handkerchiefs,
$3.66 per dozen; umbrellas, $5;
feathers, $5; clocks, $20; photographs, $8
per dozen; cottage pianos, $240; curtains,
$20; carpets, $3.62 per yard; pajamas and
dressing gowns, $16; horse carriages,
$200; bird cages, $2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Payments for goods bought before
Jan. 1, 1918, are exempt from the tax.</p>

<h3>AMERICA'S ASSISTANCE</h3>

<p>In presenting the budget the Chancellor
of the Exchequer stated that the expenditures
in the past year exceeded the
estimate by $2,030,000,000. He referred
to America's assistance as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The extent of the assistance of the
United States and our advances to the
Allies last year amounted to $2,525,000,000.
In addition to this the United States have
advanced to all the Allies no less a sum
during the year than $4,750,000,000. Of
this sum approximately $2,500,000,000 was
advanced to us and $2,250,000,000 to the
Allies.</p>

<p>The House will see, therefore, that,
whereas this year we advanced to the
Allies approximately the same amount as
last year, $2,525,000,000 as against $2,700,000,000,
the United States advanced in addition
$2,250,000,000; that is to say, the
total advances by us and by the Government
of the United States are $4,775,000,000,
as against $2,700,000,000 by us alone
last year.</p>

<p>The House would notice that our advances
to the Allies are approximately the
same amount as the advances made to us
by the Government of the United States.
This is satisfactory. It means that it is
only necessary for us to lean on the
United States to the extent that the other
Allies lean upon us, or that, in other
words, after nearly four years of war we
are self-supporting.</p>

<p>But it is almost absurd that we should
be borrowing with one hand while we are
lending with the other. The result is that
our accounts are inflated apparently, and
in fact to that extent our credit is weakened.
I have therefore been in communication
with Mr. McAdoo, the Financial
Minister of America, and Mr. Crossley,
the head of the United States Financial
Mission, and I suggested as regards
advances to the Allies a course which, if
adopted, will have the effect of lessening
to a considerable extent our burden, while
in no way increasing the total obligations
of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>THE TOTAL BRITISH DEBT</h3>

<p>In referring to the total debt the Chancellor
of the Exchequer made the following
statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The national debt, on the estimates
which I have submitted to the House,
will at the end of the present year, (March
31, 1919,) amount to $39,900,000,000. Previously,
in counting our liabilities, I have
deducted altogether advances to Allies
and Dominions. I do not propose to adopt
that course today. We cannot ignore
what is happening in Russia; though,
even yet, I do not admit&mdash;I do not believe&mdash;that
we should regard the debt of
Russia as a bad debt, because, sooner or
later, in spite of what is happening now,
there will be an ordered Government in
that country.</p>

<p>By the end of this year the total amount
due by the Allies to us will be $8,110,000,000,
and I should hope that we should
be able to deduct Dominion and obligation
debts, making a total of $5,920,000,000.
The amount of our national debt at the
end of last year was $29,250,000,000. The
amount of our liability on the basis I
have stated is $34,280,000,000, and, taking
5 per cent. on this amount as the rate of
interest, the total comes to $1,900,000,000.
This, added to the normal expenditure,
makes a total amount of $3,400,000,000.</p>

<p>Now, how is that to be met? Taking the
Inland Revenue taxation alone, it amounts
to $2,700,000,000. The Inland Revenue
officials have assured me that they have
made a very careful and a very conservative
estimate. Taking this estimate, there
<a class="pagenum" id="page_434" title="pg 434"> </a>
remains a deficit on the full year of
$550,000,000.</p>

<p>To make good this $550,000,000 I shall
impose new taxation which, on the full
year, will bring in $570,000,000. The Inland
Revenue, in their estimate of result
of existing taxation, take no account
whatever of the excess profits duty, but
that duty, as I have pointed out, is expected
to yield $1,500,000,000.</p>

<p>Assuming&mdash;an assumption that may last
for half an hour [laughter]&mdash;that the
income tax remains at 5s, that should
reach $375,000,000. Of course, that must
be supplemented. It depends upon the
state of trade and credit, but I think I am
quite safe in saying that this amount,
which they have left out of their reckoning,
is more than sufficient to counter-balance
any error made with regard to
existing taxation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>GERMANY'S WAR DEBT</h3>

<p>He followed this with a statement contrasting
the financial condition of Great
Britain with that of Germany, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Up to June, 1916, according to the statement
of the German Financial Minister,
the monthly German expenditure was
$500,000,000; it is now admitted to be
$937,500,000, which means a daily expenditure
of $31,250,000, which is almost the
same as ours. But it does not include
such matters as separation allowances.
As to the war debt, the German votes of
credit up to July amounted to $31,000,000,000.
Up to 1916 they imposed no new
taxation at all, and in that year they proposed
a war increment levy. Assuming
that their estimates were realized, the
total amount of taxation levied by the
German Government was $1,825,000,000,
as against our own amount.</p>

<p>This amount is not enough to pay the
interest of the war debt which Germany
has accumulated up to the end of the
year. The German balance sheet, reckoned
on the same basis as ours, will, with interest,
sinking fund, pensions, and pre-war
expenditures, be a year hence $3,600,000,000;
and with additional permanent
imperial revenue of $600,000,000 they
will make their total additional revenue
$925,000,000 per annum, and this amount,
added to the pre-war revenue, makes a
total of $1,675,000,000, showing a deficit
at the end of the year of $1,925,000,000.</p>

<p>If that were our position I should say
that bankruptcy was not far from the
British Nation.</p>

<p>The German taxes have been almost exclusively
indirect, imposed on commodities
paid for by the mass of the people and
not upon the wealthier classes, who control
the Government and on whom the
Government is afraid to put extra taxation.</p>

<h2>Trade After the War</h2>

<h3>Important Report by a Commission of British Experts
and Economists</h3>

<p class="drop">Great Britain's policy with reference
to future trade is outlined
in the final report of the Committee
on Commercial and Industrial
Policy After the War, of which
Lord Balfour of Burleigh was Chairman,
and which included in its membership
Arthur Balfour, (ex-Master Cutler
of Sheffield,) also the heads of the various
Boards of Trade, the textile
trades, with representatives of the shipping
and shipbuilding industries, finance,
engineering, metal trades, coal,
electrical, iron and steel associations, national
transport workers, and distinguished
economists.</p>

<p>Shipping policy after the war is not
dealt with in the report, but, in view of
the world shortage of tonnage, the committee
express the opinion that, while
it may be desirable to impose for a limited
period some restriction on the use
of British ports by enemy vessels, any
policy which might tend to check the
use of English ports by foreign shipping
generally would be inexpedient. They,
however, urge that, in accordance with
the Paris Conference resolutions, the exaction
of reparation in kind from enemy
countries should, in the interests of the
reconstruction of industry and the mercantile
marine, be carried out as fully as
may be practicable.</p>

<p>In a general survey of the position of
British industry and overseas trade in
1913, prior to the war, the committee
found that the United Kingdom had
taken only a limited share in the more
<a class="pagenum" id="page_435" title="pg 435"> </a>
modern branches of industrial production,
and that certain branches had come
to be entirely, or very largely, under
German control, and in numerous
branches foreign manufacturers had secured
a "strong, or even predominant,
position." They found that British merchants
and manufacturers had also been
encountering successful competition in
overseas trade. They believe that the
knowledge gained during the war will be
a valuable asset in the development of
British industry.</p>

<p>As to the measures which should be
adopted during the transitional period,
the committee reaffirm the main recommendations
of their interim report,
namely:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Transition Period</h3>

<p>(a) The prohibition of the importation of
goods from enemy origin should be continued,
subject to license in exceptional
cases, for at least twelve months after
the conclusion of the war, and subsequently
for such further period as may be
deemed expedient.</p>

<p>(b) The Paris resolutions relating to the
supply of the Allies for the restoration of
their industries can be carried into effect
if a policy of joint control of certain important
commodities can be agreed upon
between the British Empire and the Allies.
Any measures should aim at securing to
the British Empire and the allied countries
priority for their requirements, and
should be applied only to materials which
are mainly derived from those countries
and will be required by them. This policy
should be applied as regards the
United Kingdom by legislation empowering
the Government to prohibit the export,
except under license, of such articles as
may be deemed expedient, and, as regards
the British Empire and the allied countries,
the Government should, without
delay, enter into negotiations with the
various Governments concerned, with a
view to the adoption of suitable joint
measures in the case of selected commodities
of importance.</p>

<p>The Government should consider, in
consultation with the Allies, the expediency
of establishing after the war a joint
organization on the lines of Commission
Internationale de Ravitaillement for dealing
with the orders of the allied Governments
for reconstruction purposes, and
with such private orders as they may find
it expedient to centralize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is pointed out that the prolongation
of the war and the entry into it of the
United States have increased the importance
of a considered policy directed
toward assuring to the British Empire
and the Allies adequate supplies of
essential raw materials during the
period immediately following the conclusion
of peace, and that the extent to
which the Paris resolutions which bear
upon this vital question can be carried
into effect depends upon the co-operation
of the Governments concerned.</p>

<h3>PROBLEM OF RAW MATERIALS</h3>

<p>The committee reports that it will be
necessary to continue for a considerable
period after the war some portion of the
control of home and foreign trade in
order to secure adequate supplies of foodstuffs
and raw material. It does not
regard it as practical to attempt to
make the empire self-supporting in respect
of numerous raw materials. It
notes that the Board of Trade already
has set up a committee to investigate
the question of the supply of cotton and
it recommends special inquiries as regards
each commodity. "The object to
be kept in view should be that the empire
may be capable in an emergency
of being independent in respect of the
supply of every essential commodity of
any single foreign country."</p>

<p>The committee advises against the exclusion
of foreign (other than present
enemy) capital from sharing in the development
of the empire's resources, but
recommends:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(a) Complete disclosure, as far as is
practicable, of the extent of foreign holdings
in any particular case.</p>

<p>(b) That mineral and other properties
are not secured by foreign concerns in
order to prevent the development of those
properties, and to check competition in
supply; and</p>

<p>(c) That in the case of commodities of
great imperial importance, the local Government
concerned should have some
measure of control over the working of
the properties.</p>

<p>These principles, if accepted, should be
brought to the notice of the Governments
of other parts of the empire, with a view
to the adoption of a uniform policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>ALIENS IN BUSINESS</h3>

<p>The committee expresses the opinion
that it would not be desirable to impose
special restrictions against the participation
of aliens in commercial and industrial
<a class="pagenum" id="page_436" title="pg 436"> </a>
occupations. It recommends,
however, that such occupations as pilot
and patent agent should be confined to
British-born subjects, and suggests that
foreign commercial travelers operating
in the United Kingdom should be registered
and hold licenses, that the registration
of title to property should be compulsory,
and that such registration
should involve a declaration of the nationality
of the owner.</p>

<p>The committee deems it unwise to restrain
the establishment or the continuance
of agencies or branches of foreign
banks or insurance companies in the
United Kingdom, but foreign insurance
companies should be required to make a
deposit proportionate to the business
done. Foreign banks should be required
to pay the income tax.</p>

<p>The committee considers it necessary
to impose special restrictions on the subjects
of enemy countries, and that this
can best be done by means of stringent
permit and police regulations, but it does
not believe that attempts should be made
to prevent enemy subjects from establishing
agencies or holding interests in
commercial or industrial undertakings.</p>

<p>A plan for the maintenance and development
of industries essential to national
safety, called "Key Industries," is
proposed, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Synthetic dyes, spelter, tungsten, magnetos,
optical and chemical glass, hosiery
needles, thorium nitrate, limit and screw
gauges, and certain drugs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>SPECIAL INDUSTRIES BOARD</h3>

<p>The committee recommends the creation
of a permanent special industries
board, charged with the duty of watching
the course of industrial development
and recommending plans for the promotion
and assistance of the industries enumerated
above. With reference to industries
generally the committee thinks
that the individualist methods hitherto
adopted should be supplemented by co-operation
and co-ordination of effort in
respect of</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. The securing of supplies of materials.</p>

<p>2. Production, in which we include
standardization and scientific and industrial
research; and</p>

<p>3. Marketing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The report recommends the formation
of combinations of manufacturers, strong,
well organized associations and combinations,
to secure supplies of materials,
especially the control of mineral deposits
in foreign countries. In order to facilitate
increased production it recommends:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That an authority should be set up
which should have the right, after inquiry,
to grant compulsory powers for
the acquisition of land for industrial purposes
and the diversion or abolition of
roads or footpaths.</p>

<p>That there should be a judicial body
with compulsory powers to deal with the
question of wayleaves required for the development
of mineral royalties and the
economical working of collieries and
mines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The committee believes in the formation
of organizations for marketing the
manufactured products of the country
and deems it inexpedient for the Government
to enter into any policy aiming
at positive control of combinations
(trusts) in the United Kingdom. It
recommends that combinations be legalized,
so as to be enforceable between
members. It welcomes the establishment
of the British Trade Corporation to co-ordinate
and supplement existing financial
facilities for trading purposes. As
a general rule the members think it
would be undesirable that the State
should attempt to provide capital for
industrial purposes, but as the re-establishment
of industry on a peace basis
will be profoundly affected by taxation,
currency, and foreign exchanges, they
recommend that these matters be taken
up by the Treasury, in consultation with
the banking and commercial interests.</p>

<h3>TARIFF REGULATIONS</h3>

<p>With reference to tariff the committee
recommends a protective tariff only on
industries "which can show that, in
spite of the adoption of the most efficient
technical methods and business organization,
they cannot maintain themselves
against foreign competition, or
that they are hindered from adopting
these methods by such competition."</p>

<p>The general fiscal policy as finally
adopted by the committee is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. The producers of this country are
entitled to require from the Government
that they should be protected in their
<a class="pagenum" id="page_437" title="pg 437"> </a>
home market against "dumping" and
against the introduction of "sweated"
goods, by which term we understand
goods produced by labor which is not
paid at trade union rates of wages, where
such rates exist in the country of origin
of the goods, or the current rates of that
country where there are no trade union
rates. We recommend that action be
taken in regard to "dumping" on the
lines (though not necessarily in the precise
form) adopted in Canada.</p>

<p>2. Those industries which we have described
as "key" or "pivotal" should
be maintained in this country at all hazards
and at any expense.</p>

<p>3. As regards other industries, protection
by means of customs duties or Government
assistance in other forms should
be afforded only to carefully selected
branches of industry, which must be
maintained either for reasons of national
safety or on the general ground that it is
undesirable that any industry of real importance
to our economic strength and
well-being should be allowed to be weakened
by foreign competition or brought
to any serious extent under alien domination
or control.</p>

<p>4. Preferential treatment should be accorded
to the British oversea dominions
and possessions in respect of any customs
duties now or hereafter to be imposed in
the United Kingdom, and consideration
should be given to other forms of imperial
preference.</p>

<p>5. As regards our commercial relations
with our present allies and neutrals,
the denunciation of existing commercial
treaties is unnecessary and inexpedient,
but the present opportunity should be
taken to endeavor to promote our trade
with our allies, and consideration should
be given to the possibility of utilizing for
purposes of negotiation with them and
present neutrals any duties which may be
imposed in accordance with the principles
laid down above.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>LIMITING PROTECTIVE PRINCIPLES</h3>

<p>In view of the danger that the admission
of the principle of protection,
even to a limited extent, may give rise
to a widespread demand for similar assistance
from other industries, and consequently
to an amount of political pressure
which it may be very difficult to
resist, the committee further recommends:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That a strong and competent board,
with an independent status, should be established
to examine into all applications
from industries for State assistance, to
advise his Majesty's Government upon
such applications, and, where a case is
made out, to frame proposals as to the
precise nature and extent of the assistance
to be given.</p>

<p>Before recommending tariff protection
for any particular industry it should be
the duty of the board to consider forms
of State assistance other than, or concurrent
with, protective duties, such as
bounties on production, preferential treatment
(subject to an adequate standard
of quality and security against price
rings) in respect of Government and other
public authority contracts, State financial
assistance, and also whether the position
of the industry could not be improved
by internal reorganization.</p>

<p>The board should also have constantly
in mind the safeguarding of the interests
of consumers and of labor, and should
make recommendations as to the conditions
which for these purposes should be
attached to any form of Government assistance,
whether by means of a tariff or
otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The committee reports adversely on
the changing of weights, measures, and
coinage to the metric system.</p>

<h2>Finland Under German Control</h2>

<h3>Events of the Period of Chaos and Foreign
Invasion Preceding the Fall of Viborg</h3>

<p class="drop">Civil war, later complicated by the
German invasion, has been the
central fact in the history of Finland
since the declaration of its
independence in December, 1917. The
internecine strife was precipitated by the
coup d'&eacute;tat which the Finnish Socialists
effected in January, 1918. It so happened
that the representatives of the
propertied classes had the majority in
the Diet which severed the century-old
connection between Finland and Russia.
As for the Government which this Diet
has set up to rule the independent republic,
all its members belong to middle-class
parties. Headed by Mr. Svinhufud,
a Young-Finn leader, it includes one
Svekoman, two Agrarians, three Old-Finns,
and six Young-Finns.</p>

<p>The dissatisfaction of the Socialist elements,
which are very strong in Finland,
with this r&eacute;gime soon grew so intense
that they decided to overthrow it by
armed force. The Red Guard, that is, detachments
of armed workmen organized
by the Finnish Labor Party, seized Helsingfors,
dissolved the "bourgeois" Government,
and formed a Socialist Cabinet
under the leadership of Senator Kullervo
Manner. The revolutionists did not, however,
succeed in capturing Mr. Svinhufud
and his associates. These fled north and
established their headquarters at Vasa,
(Nikolaystadt,) on the Gulf of Bothnia.
Since then the half-starved country has
been the arena of bloody clashes between
the Red troops and the forces supporting
the Vasa Government, which consist
largely of middle-class elements and are
known as the White Guards.</p>

<p>It is an open secret that Russia rendered
substantial assistance to the Finnish
revolutionists. Most of the weapons
in their possession are from Russian
arsenals, and Russian soldiers who lingered
on in Finland even after the Bolsheviki
had agreed to withdraw the Russian
troops stationed there have been
fighting shoulder to shoulder with the
Finnish Red Guards. It is reported that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_439" title="pg 439"> </a>
on several occasions the Finnish Red
Guards were reinforced by Red Guards
from Petrograd. Moreover, in its organization
the Finnish Socialist Workmen's
Republic is a copy of the Russian
Soviet Republic. The Red Finns have
the same hierarchy of Soviets, and they
affect the administrative terminology of
the Bolsheviki.</p>

<h3>RED FINLAND</h3>

<p>The Finnish Socialists should not,
however, be treated as identical with the
Russian Bolsheviki. The difference between
them is probably due to a difference
of civilization, for culturally the
dissimilarity between a Russian and a
Finn is as great as it is linguistically
and ethnically. It is noteworthy that
unlike the Bolsheviki they regard their
own rule as a transitional, provisional
r&eacute;gime. Speaking on Feb. 14, 1918, at
the first meeting of the Finnish Central
Soviet, Kullervo Manner, President of
the Commissariat of the People of Finland,
said among other things:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the foremost aims of the great
revolution of Finland's workers is to build
the proud edifice of a political democracy
on the ruins of the fallen power of the
Junkers. * * * As soon as the enemy
of the people has been defeated throughout
the country shall the people of Finland
be given an opportunity through
referendum to accept a new Constitution.
The People's Commissariat intends shortly
to put before the Central Soviet a proposal
for a fundamental law through
which will be laid the ground for a real
representation by the people and a firm
foundation for the future of the working
class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the Finnish Socialists are
united with Russia by co-operation and
common aspirations, they do not desire
to join the Russian Federation. Finnish
socialism identifies itself with the cause
of Finnish nationalism. It was the Socialists
that were the stanchest advocates
of Finland's secession from Russia,
and it was they that, by calling a general
strike, forced the Diet to adopt immediately
the Independence bill in November,
1917.</p>

<p class="center">SKETCH MAP SHOWING FINLAND'S RELATION
TO SWEDEN, NORWAY, AND RUSSIA</p>
</div>

<p>The notion of Finland's complete sovereignty
forms the basis of the peace concluded
early in March, 1918, between the
Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic
and the Finnish Socialist Workmen's
Republic, "in order to strengthen
the friendship and fraternity between
the above-mentioned free republics."
According to this pact, published on
March 10, Russia hands over to the Independent
Finnish Socialist Republic all
its possessions in Finland, including real
estate, telegraphs, railways, fortresses,
lighthouses, and also Finnish ships which
had been requisitioned by the Russian
Government before or during the war.
Article IX. provides for "free and unimpeded
access for the merchant ships of
the Russian and Finnish Socialist Republics
to all seas, lakes and rivers, harbors,
anchoring places, and channels" within
their territories. The next article establishes
uninterrupted communication,
without trans-shipment, between the Russian
and Finnish railways. Article XIII.
contains the provision that "Finnish citizens
in Russia as well as Russian citizens
in Finland shall enjoy the same
rights as the citizens of the respective
countries."</p>

<h3>GERMAN HAND IN FINLAND</h3>

<p>If "Red" Finland has had the support
of the Russian Bolsheviki, "White" Finland
has found a most enterprising ally
in Germany. The Vasa Government has
<a class="pagenum" id="page_440" title="pg 440"> </a>
been working in direct and now open
contact with Berlin. It is overwhelmingly
pro-German. The relation between
the two Governments early assumed the
character of vassalage on the part of the
Finns. This is evidenced by the peace
agreement which official Finland concluded
with Germany on March 7. Its
full text will be found elsewhere in this
issue.</p>

<p class="center small">THE OLD CASTLE OF VIBORG, FINLAND, WHICH THE WHITE GUARDS
USED AS A FORT</p>
</div>

<p>Since the beginning of the war the
Germans have been conducting in Finland
an active campaign of espionage
and propaganda through a host of
agents and sympathizers. The propaganda
found a favorable soil among the
propertied classes, and especially among
the landed gentry of Swedish extraction.
On the other hand, the persecutions
which the Czar's bureaucracy inflicted
upon the nation, and against which
neither the French nor the British press
uttered any adequate protest, drove
some of the patriotic Finns into the arms
of Russia's enemies. A number of Finnish
youths escaped to Germany and entered
the ranks of the German Army. The
University of Helsingfors played a
prominent part in this movement. In
1915 an entire battalion made up exclusively
of Finns fought under the German
colors, while no Finns served in the
Russian Army, exemption from military
service being one of the ancient Finnish
privileges respected by the Imperial Russian
Government.</p>

<p>After the March revolution, and especially
after the fall of Riga, the efforts
of the German agents, with whom Finland
now fairly swarmed, were directed
toward fomenting Finnish separatism. In
fact, the Swedish press asserted that
from the very beginning of the war the
Germans had spent large sums of money
in trying to fan the Finns' smoldering
discontent with Russia. At the same time
Germany endeavored to enlist the sympathies
of the White Guards, (skudsh&auml;r,)
which the middle classes were hastily organizing,
ostensibly for the purpose of
assisting the militia and protecting the
population from robbers. Berlin was so
successful in its task that as early as
October, 1917, the head of the Russian
Bureau of Counterespionage in Finland
spoke of the skudsh&auml;r as "the vanguard
of the German Army." The Finns who
served in Wilhelm's army and were thoroughly
<a class="pagenum" id="page_441" title="pg 441"> </a>
indoctrinated with German military
science and German ideals were returned
to their native country, and it was
they that took upon themselves to officer
the White Guards. Some of the weapons
and munitions used by the latter were
secured from Sweden, but most of them
came from Germany and were probably
a part of the Russian booty. The above-mentioned
Russian official declared, in
an interview published in a Petrograd
daily in October, 1917, that German submarines
appeared regularly off the Finnish
coast and delivered arms and ammunition
to Finnish vessels.</p>

<h3>ATROCITIES ON BOTH SIDES</h3>

<p>The White Guards, commanded by
General Mannerheim, fought the revolutionists
with varying success but without
achieving a decisive victory. Several
towns in the south were the scene
of prolonged battles in which many lives
were lost, notably Tammerfors, the important
industrial centre, where fierce
fighting raged throughout the second
half of March. The factory districts in
the north were also the scene of stubborn
fighting. A number of women were
seen in the ranks of the Red Guards.</p>

<p>The two warring factions created a
reign of "Red" and "White" terror in
the country. Both committed frightful
atrocities. On April 17, Oskari Tokoi,
the Commissionary for Foreign Affairs
in the Socialist Cabinet, protested to all
the powers against the manner in which
General Mannerheim treated his Red
Guard prisoners. He pointed out that,
while the Red Guards regarded the captured
White Guards as prisoners of war,
the Government troops, having taken a
number of prisoners, shot all the officers
and every fifteenth man of the rank and
file. On the other hand, the corpses of
many White Guards were found unspeakably
mutilated.</p>

<p>Immediately after the outbreak of the
Socialist rebellion, the official Government
conceived the idea of appealing for
foreign military aid against the revolutionists.
On Jan. 30 such an appeal
was reported to have been sent to Sweden.
The cause of White Finland had
many sympathizers in that country. The
Finnish White Guards had a recruiting
office in Stockholm, and a number of
Swedish volunteers fought in their ranks.
A considerable portion (12 per cent.)
of the Finnish population are Swedes,
mostly members of the higher classes.
In addition, the two countries have common
historical memories, for Finland
was a Swedish province for six centuries,
from the time of Erik VIII., King of
Sweden, till the Russian annexation in
1809.</p>

<p>The Swedish Government did not, however,
elect to intervene. It is not certain
whether Stockholm refused its assistance
because Finland refused to cede the Aland
Islands to the Swedes as a compensation
for their services, or because, as Mr.
Branting asserts, Sweden was to intervene
"as the creature and ally of Germany."
The only step the Swedes took
was to send a military expedition to the
Aland Islands, in response to several appeals
from their population, which is
mostly Swedish. This measure was decided
upon by the Swedish Parliament on
Feb. 16 and was effected two or three
days later.</p>

<p>The Aland Archipelago, consisting of
about ninety inhabited islets and situated
between Abo on the Finnish coast and
Stockholm, belongs to Finland. Its
strategic importance for Sweden is aptly
characterized by an old phrase which
describes it as "a revolver aimed at the
heart of Sweden." The mission of
Sweden's troops was to clear the islands,
by moral suasion if possible, from the
bands of Russian soldiers and Finnish
White and Red Guards which for some
time had been terrorizing the population.
The Bolshevist garrison offered stubborn
resistance to the landing of the
Swedish forces.</p>

<h3>THE GERMAN INVASION</h3>

<p>At noon on March 2 a German detachment
occupied the Aland Islands. The
next day the German Minister at Stockholm
informed the Swedish Government
that Germany intended to use these
islands as a halting place for the German
military expedition into Finland, undertaken
at the request of the Finnish Government
for the purpose of suppressing
<a class="pagenum" id="page_442" title="pg 442"> </a>
the revolution. He gave assurances that
Germany sought no territorial gains in
effecting the occupation and would not
hinder the humanitarian work of the
Swedish Supervision Corps in the islands.
On March 22 the Main Committee of the
Reichstag rejected, by 12 votes against
10, the motion of the Independent Social
Democrats to evacuate the Aland Islands
and cease interfering with the internal
affairs of Finland.</p>

<p>Mr. Branting, the Swedish political
leader, denounced the talk that Finland,
deserted by Sweden, turned to Germany
in despair, as "gross hypocrisy." He is
convinced that a secret agreement existed
between Finland and Germany long
before the outbreak of the civil war, and
that Finland wants to be a dependency
under Germany rather than a member
of a Scandinavian federation of States.
Some members of the Diplomatic Corps
in Washington were also reported to believe
that the civil war was merely a
specious pretext for inviting Germany to
restore order in the country, and that the
negotiations which brought about the
German intervention had been going on
secretly for months.</p>

<p>March passed in preparations for the
expedition. On the morning of April 3
the Russian icebreaker Volinetz, which
had been captured by the White Guards,
piloted a German naval squadron, consisting
of thirty-six ships, into the Finnish
waters of Hang&ouml;, which is the extreme
southwestern point of the Finnish
coast, within a few hours of Helsingfors.
During the afternoon the Germans landed
on the peninsula of Hang&ouml; a force which,
according to an official German statement,
comprised 40,000 men under General
Sasnitz, 300 guns, and 2,000 machine
guns. The next day the Berlin
War Office issued the following statement:
"Eastern Theatre&mdash;In agreement
with the Finnish Government, German
troops have landed on the Finnish mainland."
Later more German detachments
were landed at Abo.</p>

<p>According to one report, the Germans,
upon their landing, opened negotiations
with the Finnish Socialists, but their
overtures were apparently rejected. The
Russian Government immediately protested
to Germany against the landing in
Finland. The German Government replied
by demanding that the Russian war
vessels in Finnish territorial waters
should either leave for Russian ports or
disarm, according to Article 5 of the
Brest-Litovsk treaty, on or before midday,
April 12. The Bolsheviki ordered
the commander of the Baltic fleet to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_443" title="pg 443"> </a>
carry out this demand. Four Russian
submarines were fired upon and sunk by
the Germans at Hang&ouml; during the landing
and several other Russian warships
were blown up by their own crews for
fear of being captured by the Germans.</p>

</div>

<p>On April 13 the Finnish Official News
Bureau gave out a statement to the
effect that all German troops landed in
Finland had been dispatched at the request
of the Finnish Government. On
April 17 the Germans landed 40,000 men
at Helsingfors. Their naval squadron
stationed in the harbor of the Finnish
capital consisted of twelve vessels.</p>

<h3>FALL OF VIBORG</h3>

<p>The Red Guards offered a stubborn
resistance to the invaders, but it soon
became apparent that their cause was
lost. Upon the landing of the Germans,
the Socialist Government escaped from
Helsingfors and established itself at Viborg,
seventy-five miles northwest of
Petrograd. On April 13 the German
troops, aided by naval detachments, entered
Helsingfors, "after a vigorous encounter
with armed bands," as the German
official announcements read. According
to a Reuter dispatch, a three
days' battle preceded the capture of the
Finnish capital. It was taken by storm
after fierce fighting in the streets. About
the same time the City of Abo was taken
by the White Guards. The Germans
then proceeded to move on Viborg. On
April 23 the Finnish Socialist Government
protested to the allied representatives,
including the American Ambassador
to Russia, against the German interference.
It declared that the Finnish
Socialists would continue for the cause
of freedom, with "a profound hatred
and contempt for the executioners of nations
and of the labor movement."</p>

<p>Viborg fell into the hands of the White
Guards on April 30, after nearly all its
defenders, 6,000 in all, were slaughtered.
Among the prisoners taken was Kullerwo
Manner, the President of the Socialist
Government. On May 4 Berlin was able
to announce complete victory in Finland.
The official report follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finland has been cleared of the enemy.
German troops, in co-operation with Finnish
battalions, attacked the enemy between
Lakhti and Tevasthus in an encircling
movement, and in a five days'
battle, in spite of a bitter defense and
desperate attempts to break through, we
have overwhelmingly defeated him. The
Finnish forces cut off his retreat in a
northerly direction. The enemy is closed
in on every side, and, after the heaviest
losses, is laying down his arms. We
took 20,000 prisoners. Thousands of
vehicles and horses were captured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A dispatch dated May 8 reported, however,
that the country was far from
pacified, and that the Red Guards continued
to offer resistance at many points.</p>

<p>Speaking before the Main Committee
of the Reichstag, on May 8, Friedrich
von Payer, the German Imperial Vice
Chancellor, defended Germany's intervention
in Finland. The fundamental
<a class="pagenum" id="page_444" title="pg 444"> </a>
aim of this step was "to create in North
Finland a final condition of peace, both
military and political." He stated that
the entire staff of the 43d Russian Army
Corps was recently captured in Finland.
He denied that Germany intended further
to interfere in the inner affairs of
Finland, and added that Germany had
concluded economic and political treaties
with Finland whereby both parties would
profit.</p>

<h3>UNDER GERMAN DOMINATION</h3>

<p>While these military operations were
being carried on, Finland was becoming a
German province. Late in March an
American and an English officer, visiting
General Mannerheim at Vasa upon orders
from their legations, were threatened by
Finnish White Guard officers with personal
violence and turned out of the dining
room of the chief hotel. This incident
was described as characteristic of the
feeling existing among the majority of
Finns. On April 1 Vasabladet, the chief
Vasa newspaper, wrote: "No military
or other similar persons from any of
the countries at war with Germany
ought to be allowed to stay within the
borders of our country so long as we,
with the help of God and Germany, are
fighting our hard fight for liberty,
order, and justice against the barbarous
ally of the western powers." It appears
from a case reported on April 26
that the vis&eacute;ing of foreign passports by
Finnish officials depends now upon the
consent of the Berlin authorities.</p>

<p>Finland was proclaimed a republic in
December, 1917. It has always been one
of the most democratic countries in
Europe. It is asserted, nevertheless, that
the experiences through which the former
grand duchy has passed in the last six
months have converted many classes of
the population to monarchism. A Stockholm
dispatch dated May 8 declared that
a monarchy would probably be proclaimed
in Finland, and that Duke Adolph
Frederick of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, uncle
of the Crown Princess of Germany, would
be appointed King.</p>

<h3>GREATER FINLAND</h3>

<p>In the middle of April it became known
that the Finnish statesmen had an ambitious
plan for the territorial aggrandizement
and political expansion of their
country at the expense of Russia, and
possibly also of Norway. A Stockholm
paper published a statement that Germany
had agreed to the establishment
of a Greater Finland, to include the territory
of the Petrograd-Murman railway
to the arctic. The newspaper added
that the Finnish railway system was to
be enlarged with a view to establishing
direct connection from North Cape to
Budapest and Constantinople. Thus Finland
would become the cornerstone of a
"Mitteleuropa" stretching from the
arctic coast to Asia Minor and beyond.
A well-known Finnish painter stated in
an interview that the Finnish troops, co-operating
with the Germans, would take
Petrograd as well as the south coast of
the Gulf of Finland, which is ethnically
Finnish. An announcement was made
on May 8, before the Main Committee of
the Reichstag, that no Germans were
participating or would participate in the
advance of Finnish troops on Petrograd.</p>

<p>A movement has been set afoot among
Karelians, presumably by Finns, in
favor of the Finnish annexation of Russian
Karelia, on the basis of the principle
of self-determination. Karelia includes
parts of the Governments of Petrograd,
Olonetz, and Archangel; its
aboriginal population belongs to the Finnish
race.</p>

<h2>Peace Treaty Between Finland and Germany</h2>

<h3>Full Text of the Document</h3>

<p class="drop">The Imperial Government of Berlin
announced on March 7, 1918, that a
treaty of peace between Germany
and Finland had been signed. Two days
later the full text was transmitted from
Berlin to London through the wireless
stations of the German Government.
This treaty with Germany was made by
the element in the Republic of Finland
represented in a military way by the
White Guards, who were pro-German
and co-operated with the German army
sent immediately afterward to make war
in Finland against the Red Guards, who
represented the Bolshevist element of the
Finnish population. During April an
armed conflict between the Reds and the
Germans raged around Helsingfors,
where the Bolshevist forces fought to
annul this treaty, though with steadily
diminishing prospects of success.</p>

<p>The full text of the treaty follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Royal German Government and the
Finnish Government, inspired by the wish,
after the declaration of the independence of
Finland and its recognition through Germany,
to bring about a condition of peace
and friendship between both countries on a
lasting basis, have resolved to conclude a
peace, and for this purpose they have appointed
the following plenipotentiaries: For
the Royal German Government, the Chancellor
of the German Empire, Dr. Count von
Hertling; for the Finnish Government, Dr.
Phil Edvard Immanuel Hjelt, State Adviser,
Vice Councilor of the University of Helsingfors,
and Rafael Waldemar Erich, LL.D.,
Professor of State Law and of the Law
of Nations at the University of Helsingfors,
who, after the mutual setting forth in good
order and form of their plenipotentiary powers,
have come to an agreement on the following
provisions:</p>

<p><i>CHAPTER I.&mdash;Friendship Between Germany
and Finland and the Assuring
of the Independence of Finland</i></p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 1.</span> The contracting parties declare
that between Germany and Finland
no state of war exists and that they are
resolved henceforth to live in peace and
friendship with each other. Germany will do
what she can to bring about the recognition
of the independence of Finland by all the
powers. On the other hand, Finland will not
cede any part of her possessions to any foreign
power nor constitute a charge on her
sovereign territory to any such power before
first having come to an understanding with
Germany on the matter.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 2.</span> Diplomatic and consular relations
between the contracting
parties will be resumed immediately after the
confirmation of the peace treaty. The freest
possible admission of Consuls on both sides is
to be provided for by arrangements in special
treaties.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 3.</span> Each of the contracting parties
will replace the damage which
has been caused in its own territory by the
war, or which the States or populations have
brought about by actions contrary to international
law, or which has been caused by
the consular officials of the other party either
to life, liberty, health, or property.</p>

<p><i>CHAPTER II.&mdash;War Indemnities</i></p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 4.</span> The contracting parties renounce
mutually the making good of
war costs; that is to say, State expenses for
the carrying on of the war as well as the
payment of war indemnities; that is to say,
of those prejudices which have arisen for
them and their subjects in the war zones by
reason of the military measures connected
with all the requisitions undertaken in enemy
country.</p>

<p><i>CHAPTER III.&mdash;The Re-entry Into
Force of State Treaties</i></p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 5.</span> The treaties which lapsed as
a consequence of the war between
Germany and Russia shall be replaced
as soon as possible by new treaties
for relations between the contracting parties,
and they shall be made to correspond
to the new outlook and conditions which
have now arisen. Especially the contracting
parties shall at once enter into negotiations
in order to draw up a treaty for the settlement
of trade and shipping relations between
the two countries, to be signed at
the same time as the peace treaty.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 6.</span> Treaties in which, apart from
Germany and Russia, also a
third power takes part, and in which Finland
appears together with Russia or in
the place of the latter, come into force between
the contracting parties on the ratification
of peace treaty or, in case the entry
takes place later, at that moment. In
connection with collective treaties of political
contents, in which other belligerent powers
are also involved, the two parties reserve
their attitude until after the conclusion
of a general peace.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_446" title="pg 446"> </a></p>

<p><i>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;Re-establishment of
Private Rights</i></p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 7.</span> All stipulations existing in the
territory of either of the contracting
parties, according to which, in
view of the state of war, subjects of the
other party are subjected to any special
regulation whatever in the observation of
their private rights, cease to be of force on
the confirmation of this treaty. Subjects
of either of the contracting parties are such
legal persons and societies as have their
domicile in the respective territories. Furthermore,
subjects of either of the parties,
legal persons and societies which do not
have their domicile in the territory, must
be regarded as on the same level in so far
as in the territory of the other party they
were submitted to the stipulations applying
to such subjects.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 8.</span> With regard to the civil debt
conditions which have been influenced
by war laws, the following has been
agreed:</p>

<p>1. The debt conditions will be re-established
in so far as the stipulations in Articles 8 to
12 do not decide otherwise.</p>

<p>2. The stipulation in Paragraph 1 does not
prejudice the question as to what extent the
conditions created by the war (especially
the impossibility of settlement of debt owing
to the obstacles in traffic or commercial
prohibitions in the territory of either of the
contracting parties) shall be taken into account
in the determination of claims of
subjects of either party in accordance with
the laws applying thereto in the respective
territories.  In this connection subjects of
the other party who have been prevented by
the measures of that party, are not to be
dealt with more unfavorably than the subjects
of their own State, who have been prevented
by the measures of that State.</p>

<p>A person who by the war has been prevented
from carrying out in good time a payment
shall not be obliged to make good the damage
which has occurred owing thereto.</p>

<p>3. Demands of money, whose payment
could be refused during the war on the
strength of war laws, need not be paid until
after the expiration of three months after
the confirmation of the peace treaty. In so
far as nothing else has been stipulated in
the supplementary treaty, an interest of 5
per cent. per annum must be paid on such
debts from the original date on which they
were due, for the duration of the war and
the further three months, regardless of
moratoriums. Up to the day on which they
were originally due, the interests agreed
upon, if any, must be paid. In the case of
bills or checks submission for payment as
well as protests against nonpayment must
take place within the fourth month after the
confirmation of this treaty.</p>

<p>4. For the settlement of outstanding affairs
and other civil obligations, officially
recognized unions for the protection of debtors
and for the examination of claims of lay
and legal persons belonging to the union, as
well as their plenipotentiaries, are to be
mutually recognized and permitted.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 9.</span> Each contracting party will
immediately after the confirmation
of the peace treaty resume payment
of its obligations, especially the public debt
duties to subjects of the other party. The
obligations which became due before the confirmation
of the treaty will be paid within
three months after the confirmation.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 10.</span> Copyrights, trade protective
rights, concessions and privileges,
as well as similar claims on public
legal foundations, which have been influenced
by war laws, shall be re-established,
in so far as nothing else has been stipulated
in Article 12.</p>

<p>Each contracting party will grant subjects
of the other party who on account of the
war have neglected the legal period in which
to undertake an action necessary for the
establishment or maintenance of a trade
protective right, without prejudice to the
justly obtained rights of third parties, a
period of at least one year in which to recover
the action. Trade protective rights
of subjects of one party which were in force
on the outbreak of war, shall not expire in
the territory of the other party, owing to
their non-application, till after the termination
of four years from the confirmation of
this treaty. If in the territory of one of
the contracting parties a trade protective
right, which in accordance with the war
laws could not be applied for, is applied for
by an agent who during the war has taken
protective measures in the territory of the
other party in accordance with the rules,
such right, if claimed within six months
after the confirmation of the treaty, shall,
with the reservation of the rights of third
parties, have priority over all applications
submitted in the meantime, and cannot be
made ineffective by facts which have arisen
in the meantime.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 11.</span> Periods for the superannuation
of rights shall, in the territory
of each of the contracting parties, toward
subjects of the other party, expire at
the earliest one year after the confirmation
of the peace treaty in so far as they had
not expired at the time of the outbreak of
war. The same applies to periods for the
submission of dividend-warrants or warrants
for shares in profit, as well as to bills
which have become redeemable or have become
otherwise payable.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 12.</span> The activities of authorities
who on the strength of war
laws have become occupied with the supervision,
custody, administration, or liquidation
of property or with the receiving of payments,
are without prejudice to the stipulations
<a class="pagenum" id="page_447" title="pg 447"> </a>
of Article 13, to be wound up in accordance
with the following principles:</p>

<p>1. Properties under supervision, in custody
or under administration, are to be set free
immediately on the demand of the parties
entitled to them. Until the moment of transfer
to the entitled party care must be taken
for the safeguarding of his interests.</p>

<p>2. The provisions of Paragraph 1 shall not
modify the properly acquired right of a third
party. Payments and other obligations of a
debtor which, as mentioned at the beginning
of the article, have been received or caused
to be received at the places mentioned, shall,
in the territories of the contracting parties,
have the same effect as if the creditor himself
had received them.</p>

<p>Civil dispositions which have been made at
the places mentioned at the instigation of
the parties or by them will have full effect
and are to be maintained by the parties.</p>

<p>3. Regarding the operations of the places
mentioned at the beginning of this article,
especially those for receipts and payments,
details shall at once be given to the authorized
parties immediately upon demand.
Claims which have been lodged to be dealt
with at these places can only be dealt with
in accordance with the stipulations of Article
14.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 13.</span> Land or rights in land or in
mines as well as rights in the
use or exploitation of lands, or undertakings,
or claims for participation in an undertaking,
especially those represented by
shares, which have been forcibly alienated
from the persons entitled to them by reason
of war laws, shall be transferred to the
former owner within a period of one year
after the confirmation of the peace treaty,
and there shall be returned to him any profits
which have accrued on such property during
the alienation or deprivation, and this shall
be done free from all rights of third parties
which may have arisen in the meantime.</p>

<p><i>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;Indemnity for Civil
Damages</i></p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 14.</span> Subjects of one of the contracting
parties resident in the territory
of the other contracting party who, by
reason of war laws, have suffered damage
either by the temporary or lasting privation
of concessions, privileges, and similar claims,
or by the supervision, trusteeship, administration
or alienation of property, are to be
appropriately indemnified so far as the damage
by the war cannot be replaced by the
actual re-establishment of their former conditions.
This also applies to shareholders
who, on account of their character as foreign
enemies, are excluded from certain
rights.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 15.</span> Each of the contracting parties
will indemnify the civilian subjects
of the other party for damages which
have been caused to them in its territory
during the war by the State officials or the
population there through breaches of international
law and acts of violence against
life, health, or property.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 16.</span> Each of the contracting parties
will at once pay to the
subjects of the other party their just claims
so far as this has not already been done.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 17.</span> For the fixing of the damages,
according to Articles 14 and
15, there shall meet in Berlin a commission
immediately after the confirmation of this
treaty which shall consist of one-third of
each of the contracting parties and one-third
of neutrals. The President of the Swiss
Bundesrat shall be asked to nominate the
neutral members, from whom the Chairman
shall be chosen. The commission shall
fix the principles, on which it is to work,
and it shall decide as to what procedure it
shall follow. Its decisions shall be carried
out by sub-commissions, which shall consist
of one representative from each of the contracting
parties and a neutral umpire. The
amounts fixed by the sub-commissions are
to be paid within one month of the decision
being made.</p>

<p><i>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;The Exchange of Prisoners
of War and Interned Civilians</i></p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 18.</span> Finnish prisoners of war in
Germany and German prisoners
of war in Finland shall, as soon as practicable,
be exchanged within the times fixed
by a German-Finnish Commission, and subject
to the payment of the costs entailed in
such exchange in so far as those prisoners
do not wish to stay in the country where
they happen to be, with its consent, or to go
to another country. The commission will
also have to settle the further details of
such exchange and to supervise their execution.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 19.</span> The deported or interned civilians
on both sides will be
sent home as soon as practicable free of
charge so far as, subject to the consent of
the country on whose territory they are
staying, they do not wish to remain there
or wish to go to another country. The
settlement of the details and the supervision
of their execution shall be carried out
by the commission mentioned in Article 18.
The Finnish Government will endeavor to
obtain from the Russian Government the
release of those Germans who were captured
in Finnish territory and who at the
present time are outside Finnish on Russian
territory.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 20.</span> Subjects of one party who at
the outbreak of war had their
domicile or commercial establishments in
the territory of the other party and who
did not remain in that territory may return
there as soon as the other party is not in
a state of war. Their return can only be
refused on the ground of the endangering
of the internal or foreign safety of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_448" title="pg 448"> </a>
State. It would suffice that a pass be made
out by the authorities of the home Government
in which it is to be stated that the
bearer is one of those persons as stipulated
in Item 1. No vis&eacute; is to be necessary on
these passes.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 21.</span> Each of the Contracting Parties
undertakes to respect and
to tend the several burial places of subjects
of the other party who fell in the war as
well as those who died during internment
or deportation and the persons intrusted by
each party with care and proper decoration
of the burial places may attend to these
duties in accord with the authorities of each
country. Questions connected with the care
of such burial places are reserved for
further agreements.</p>

<p><i>CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;Amnesty.</i></p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 22.</span> Each of the contracting parties
concedes amnesty from penalties
to the subjects of the other party who
are prisoners of war for all criminal acts
committed by them and further to all civilian
interned or deported subjects of the other
party for all punishable acts committed by
them during their internment or deportation
period, and lastly to all subjects of the other
party for crimes against all exceptional laws
made to the disadvantage of enemy foreigners.
The amnesty will not apply to actions
committed after the confirmation of the
peace treaty.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 23.</span> Each party concedes complete
amnesty to all its own subjects
in view of the work which they have
done in the territory of the other party as
prisoners of war, interned civilians, or deported
civilians.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 24.</span> The contracting parties reserve
to themselves the right to make
further agreements according to which each
party may grant an amnesty of penalties
decreed on account of actions committed to
its disadvantage.</p>

<p><i>CHAPTER IX.&mdash;The Treatment of Mercantile
Vessels and Cargoes Which
Have Fallen Into the Hands
of the Enemy.</i></p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 25.</span> Mercantile ships of one contracting
party which lay in the
ports of the other contracting party on the
outbreak of the war, as well as their cargoes,
are to be given back to their owners, or in
so far as this is not possible they are to be
paid for in money. For the use of such embargoed
vessels during the war the usual
daily freight is to be paid.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 26.</span> German mercantile ships and
their cargoes which are in the
power of Finland, except in cases foreseen in
Article 25 at the signing of this treaty or
which may arrive there later, are to be given
back if on the outbreak of war they were in
an enemy port or were interned in neutral
waters by enemy forces.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Article 27.</span> The mercantile vessels of
either of the contracting parties
captured as prizes in the zone of power
of the other party shall be regarded as definitely
confiscated if they have been legally
condemned as prizes, and if they do not
come under the provisions of Articles 25 and
26. Otherwise they are to be given back, or,
in so far as they are no longer available,
they are to be paid for. The provisions of
Paragraph 1 are to apply also to ships' cargoes
taken as prizes belonging to subjects
of the contracting parties, but goods belonging
to subjects of one of the contracting
parties on board ships flying enemy flags
which have fallen into the hands of the other
contracting party are in all cases to be

<h2>German Aggression in Russia</h2>

<h3>Record of Events Placing Finland and the
Ukraine More Fully Under Teutonic Control</h3>

<p class="drop">During the month ended May 15,
1918, the German advance in the
territory of the former Russian
Empire continued uninterruptedly.
While minor military operations
were conducted in the Province of Kursk,
in Russia proper, the main body of the
invading army occupied the Crimea and
penetrated into the Donetz coal basin. On
April 24 the German troops, under General
Kosch, reached the City of Simferopol,
in the Crimea. A week later they
occupied Sebastopol, the great military
and commercial seaport, famous in Russian
history. A portion of the Russian
Black Sea fleet fell into the hands of
the Germans. On May 3 the invaders
seized Taganrog, on the Sea of Azov. On
May 9 they took Rostov, at the mouth
of the River Don, but two days later the
city was again in Russian hands. The
Germans are apparently intent on occupying
the seacoast from Bessarabia,
on the west, to the Caucasus, on the east.</p>

<p>The Bolshevist r&eacute;gime gave signs of
undergoing a process of reorganization.
It sought to enlist the services of officials
who had served under the Provisional
Government and of Generals of
the old army. A new War Department
was formed. Trotzky, the Minister of
War and Marine, advocated universal
conscription of labor. The Central Executive
Committee, at his suggestion, decreed
compulsory military service. Workmen
and peasants from 18 to 40 years
old were to be trained for eight consecutive
weeks, for a weekly minimum of
eight hours. Women were accepted into
the army as volunteers.</p>

<p>The Bolshevist authorities made several
attempts to suppress rioting and
street looting. Early in May the Red
Guards fought a pitched battle with the
Moscow anarchists, who refused to surrender
their munitions, and stamped out
their organization. The Soviets passed
resolutions and took measures against
the anti-Jewish massacres which occurred
in numerous cities. Disorder and
mob rule, however, continued to prevail
in Russia, while hunger and unemployment
were daily increasing.</p>

<h3>INDUSTRY CRIPPLED</h3>

<p>On April 16 M. Gukovsky, the Commissary
for Finance, reported to the Central
Executive Committee of the Soviets
on Russia's financial and industrial condition.
He said that the semi-yearly expenditure
would amount to 4,000,000,000
rubles, while the income expected was
only 3,300,000,000 rubles. The railroads
had lost 70 per cent. of their freight
capacity, and the cost of operation had
increased ten times, (120,000 against
11,600 rubles per versta.) The Central
Government, he stated, derived no revenue
from taxes, as the local Soviets used the
sums they collected for their own purposes.
To illustrate the industrial conditions
the Commissary cited the example of
the Sormov locomotive works, whose daily
output is two locomotives, instead of
eighteen as formerly. M. Gukovsky
recommended strict economy in expenditures
and urged the necessity of securing
the services of financial and industrial
experts for the purpose of organizing
an efficient State machinery.</p>

<p>Among the recent legislative measures
of the Moscow Government must be mentioned
the nationalization of foreign
trade, which is a part of the general Bolshevist
scheme of Socialist reforms. A
special board has been created to regulate
the prices of all exports and imports.</p>

<p>In the middle of April hostilities were
reopened between the newly collected
troops of General Korniloff, former Russian
Commander in Chief, and the Bolshevist
forces. It was reported that the
Bolsheviki heavily defeated the anti-Soviet
troops, capturing Novocherkask and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_450" title="pg 450"> </a>
wounding the Cossack General. It
was also stated that General Dutoff, another
anti-Bolshevist leader, was captured
by the Soviet troops, and that General
Semyonov, the leader of the Cossack
movement against the Bolsheviki in Siberia,
was killed.</p>

<p>The incident of the Japanese landing at
Vladivostok was near closing, when
further interest in the Far Eastern situation
was aroused in Russia by a number
of documents seized on the person of a
member of the anti-Soviet "Siberian
Government." According to a note addressed
on April 26 by M. Chicherin to
diplomatic representatives in Moscow,
these documents proved that the Consuls
of Great Britain, France, and America&mdash;and
the diplomatic representatives of
these powers in Peking&mdash;sought to interfere
in the internal affairs of Russia by
participating in the counter-revolutionary
movement for an autonomous Government
in Siberia. A similar charge was
laid to the Japanese officials. The Russian
Government, therefore, demanded
the recall of the allied Consular officers
at Vladivostok, also asking the Allies to
define their attitude toward the Soviet
Government. Neither Ambassador Francis
nor the French Ambassador, M.
Noulens, made any official reply to the
Russian charges. M. Noulens had previously
drawn upon himself the wrath of
the Bolsheviki by declaring that the
armed intervention of the Allies in Russia
would be an act of friendly assistance.
Mr. Francis informally notified the Moscow
Government that, in his opinion, the
documents failed to involve the American
officials. On May 9 Secretary Lansing
instructed him to present informally to
the Russian Foreign Office a denial of
its charge against the American Consul
at Vladivostok.</p>

<h3>ENEMY PROPAGANDA</h3>

<p>In a speech on April 27 Baron Shimpei
Goto, the new Japanese Foreign Minister,
referred to the malevolent propaganda
which is being conducted in Russia with
a view to creating an estrangement between
Japan and Russia. He expressed
the view that "Russia is a power endeavoring
to reorganize a machine temporarily
out of order," adding: "Japan
must give encouragement, assistance,
and support to the work of reorganization
in Russia. We trust the sound
sense of the Russian people will not be
misled by reports calculated to keep the
two neighbors apart."</p>

<p>Shortly after the capture of Sebastopol
the Russian Government protested to
Germany against the seizure of the Black
Sea fleet and the invasion of the Crimea.
The Russian note pointed out that these
acts were in contravention of the Brest
treaty and that they might endanger the
peaceful relations between the two countries.
The Germans did not seem to be
concerned to maintain these relations.
They treated the population of the occupied
territories with harshness. Starving
refugees were not admitted into the
regions under their domination. It was
reported that in the Government of Minsk
able-bodied persons were seized in the
streets and sent to Germany in locked
cars. Constant food requisitioning was
another feature of the German rule in
Russia.</p>

<h3>RUSSIA'S PROTEST</h3>

<p>On April 15 M. Chicherin, Russian
Commissary for Foreign Affairs, protested
to Berlin against the outrages committed
by the German troops in Russia.
The text of the note follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Central Soviet institutions receive
many complaints with regard to German
troops burning Russian villages and using
violence against Russian inhabitants.
An eyewitness well known to us and absolutely
trustworthy states that at Lepel,
northwest of Mogileff, German soldiers
killed a whole family, not sparing women
and children, on the plea that one of the
family belonged to a partisan detachment.
The local military authorities state that
at the village of Novoselki, Mogileff, on
April 5, there appeared an officer and
soldiers of the 346th Regiment and took
oats from the inhabitants by force. The
officer was killed by the peasants, and the
soldiers fled. After this the village was
surrounded by the soldiers, fired on by
machine guns, and burned.</p>

<p>The following day the German commander
sent a notice to the Russian military
authorities at Orsha saying that the
inhabitants of Novoselki had been ejected,
and the village burned owing to a German
officer's being killed.</p>

<p class="center">
MAP OF THE UKRAINE AND OTHER REGIONS OF RUSSIA NOW UNDER GERMAN DOMINATION</p>
</div>

<p>Observers of Russian life agree that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_451" title="pg 451"> </a>
feelings of resentment and animosity on
the part of the Russian population for
the German oppressor are steadily growing
throughout the country. At the same
time good feeling between the Russians
and the Allies, especially the Americans,
is on the increase. British and French
troops are co-operating with Bolshevist
forces in defending against Finns and
Germans the Murman seacoast and the
railway from the interior of Russia to
the arctic ports of Alexandrovsk and
Archangel, where large supplies of valuable
war materials are stored up. The
War Council attached to the Murman
local Soviet consists of one Russian, one
Englishman, and one Frenchman. The
landing of the allied troops at Alexandrovsk
the Germans regarded as a violation
of the Brest treaty, which provides
for peace with Finland, and protested to
the Moscow Government against the act.</p>

<p>The constant exchange of protests between
Berlin and Moscow is partly caused
by the ambiguous wording of the Brest
treaty. On April 24 Adolf Joffe, the
Bolshevist Ambassador in Berlin, telegraphed
to Moscow that the Russian
translation of the treaty was considered
by the German authorities incorrect, and
that the publication of the final draft of
the document was postponed until the receipt
of an authentic version.</p>

<h3>DISMEMBERING RUSSIA</h3>

<p>It appears that Germany has been making
further attempts to encourage the
separatist tendency in Russia, in contravention
<a class="pagenum" id="page_452" title="pg 452"> </a>
of the Brest treaty. The German
Government is reported to have inquired
of the local Crimean authorities
concerning the nationalization of their
flag. The Bolsheviki interpreted this
step as indicative of the German desire to
separate the Taurida Republic from the
Russian Federation.</p>

<p>According to a communication issued
by the Rumanian Charg&eacute; d'Affaires, the
National Assembly of Bessarabia voted,
on April 9, the union of the province to
Rumania by 86 against 3. Thereupon,
the Rumanian Premier, amid enthusiastic
acclamation, proclaimed the union to
be "definitive and indissoluble," and a
delegation was sent to Jassy to present
the homage of the people of Bessarabia
to the King. Rumania seems to have
acted at the suggestion of Germany. It
is known that the latter proposed to
Rumania to annex a part of Bessarabia
and thus compensate herself for Rumanian
territory taken by Austria-Hungary
and Bulgaria. It is also known
that (on March 22?) Russia signed a
treaty with Rumania regarding Bessarabia.
The province was to be evacuated
by the Rumanian troops, which had occupied
it at the request of the population,
and the guarding of Bessarabia was to
pass into the hands of local militia, while
all evacuated places were to be immediately
occupied by Russian troops. Russia
undertook to leave Rumania the surplus
of Bessarabian grain remaining
after the local population and Russian
troops had been provided for. The
Ukrainian Government refused to recognize
the step taken by Bessarabia.</p>

<p>According to the terms of the Brest
treaty the Baltic Provinces Esthonia and
Livonia were to remain under Russian
sovereignty, but three weeks later Germany
began intriguing for a union of
these countries with the Kingdom of Russia.
The falsity of the assertion that the
people of Esthonia favored a Baltic
monarchy was exposed by the following
protest of the Esthonian Provisional Government,
published April 22:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the communication from Berlin
that the joint Landtag of Esthonia,
Livonia, Riga, and Oesel has decided upon
the separation of Baltic provinces from
Russia and the creation of a Baltic monarchy
in personal union with Prussia, I
declare, as representative of the Esthonian
Republic, that this resolution does
not constitute an expression of opinion
of the Esthonian people, but only that of
a German nobility minority and its adherents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On May 5 the British Government informally
recognized the Esthonian Provisional
Government and, in the words of
Mr. Balfour's communication, reaffirmed
their readiness to grant provisional
recognition to the Esthonian National
Council as a de facto independent body
until the peace conference, when the
future status of Esthonia ought to be
settled as far as possible in accordance
with the wishes of the population."</p>

<p>On April 26 Transcaucasia declared its
independence under a conservative Government,
headed by M. Chkhemkeli.</p>

<p>Count von Mirbach, the Royal German
Ambassador to Russia, accompanied by
a Turkish representative, arrived in Moscow
on April 23. He was welcomed by
the Chairman of the Central Executive
Committee as "a representative of a
power with which a peace treaty has
been concluded at Brest-Litovsk, as a
result of which peace, so needed by the
people, was established between the two
States." Pravda, the official Bolshevist
daily, greeted the Royal German Ambassador
as "the plenipotentiary of an
armed band which with limitless audacity
oppresses and robs wherever it
is able to thrust in with a bloody imperialistic
bayonet."</p>

<h3>ULTIMATUM ON PRISONERS</h3>

<p>Germany has shown eagerness to obtain
the release and the use of the able-bodied
German prisoners who are now in
Russia. It is believed that there are at
present upward of 1,000,000 German
prisoners of war in European Russia and
Siberia. It was reported on April 27
that a special German commission had
arrived in Moscow to take charge of the
exchange of prisoners with Russia, and
that exchanges of invalids had already
begun. The number of Russians in German
hands is estimated at 3,000,000. An
earlier official German communication
explained the delay in repatriating Russians
by the lack of transportation facilities.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_453" title="pg 453"> </a>
On April 29 the State Department
at Washington gave out the following
statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Department of State has learned
that there will shortly leave for Russia a
German commission, consisting of 115
members, which will take up the question
of the exchange of Russian and German
prisoners. It is reported that it is the
purpose of the commission merely to present
to the Russian authorities an ultimatum
from Germany requiring, first,
the immediate release of all German prisoners
who are in good health; second,
that those who are ill will remain in Russia
under the care of neutral physicians,
and, third, that the Germans on their side
will release only those Russian prisoners
in Germany who are invalids or who are
incapacitated. In the event of a refusal
on the part of Russia, Germany will order
that Petrograd be taken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upon the heels of this ultimatum
came another one, served on the Council
of the People's Commissaries by the German
Ambassador, Count von Mirbach.
According to a dispatch, the new ultimatum,
too, dated May 10, had a bearing
on the prisoner question, but in addition
demanded complete cessation of
arming troops and the disbandment of
units already formed. This demand produced
an unusual stir in Russia. The
Commissaries held an extraordinary session
at which the situation created by the
ultimatum was discussed. The Bolsheviki
showed no intention of complying
with the German ultimatum.</p>

<p>On May 12 Foreign Minister Chicherin
instructed the Russian Ambassador, M.
Joffe, at Berlin to "try to obtain from
Berlin cessation of every kind of hostility."
The Germans had announced their
intention to capture Novorossiysk, on the
Caucasian coast of the Black Sea, under
the pretext that the Russian warships,
which had escaped seizure at Sebastopol
and which are stationed at Novorossiysk,
constituted a danger for the German
vessels. The instruction added that the
German invasion of Russian territory was
causing much unrest in the country.</p>

<h3>COUP IN THE UKRAINE</h3>

<p>On April 18 the State Department at
Washington announced that, according to
an authentic report, the Teutons intended
to dissolve the Ukrainian Rada and set
up a Government of their own. On
April 24 a Ukrainian financier prominent
in aiding the Germans was arrested
in the name of "the Committee of
Ukrainian Safety." The German Vice
Chancellor, Friedrich von Payer, in his
speech before the Main Committee of the
Reichstag, said that this secret organization
aimed at driving the Germans out
of the country and was even planning the
assassination of all German officers. It
included a number of prominent Ukrainians,
several Ministers of State among
them, and held its meetings at the house
of the Minister of War. An investigation
was demanded by the German Ambassador,
but the Rada took no action.</p>

<p>Two days later General von Eichhorn,
Commander of the German Army in the
Ukraine, proclaimed "a state of enhanced
protection," making all offenders
of order subject to the jurisdiction of
German court-martial. He had previously
issued a field-sowing decree,
necessitated, as the Germans explained,
by the fact that the Rada had taken no
measures concerning the field sowing,
without which the country could not meet
its treaty obligations relative to the delivery
of grain to Germany. On April
28, while the Rada was in session, German
troops entered the hall and arrested
a number of its members, the Minister of
War among them. The next day a number
of landowners and rich peasants who
were holding a convention in Kiev declared
its sessions permanent, voted the
dissolution of the Rada as well as the
cancellation of the order convoking the
Constituent Assembly on May 12, and
proclaimed General Skoropadsky Hetman
(Supreme Military Chief) of the
Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Rada ceased to exist. It had but
scant support in the country. A creature
of the Teutons, it was supported by
their armed forces. It proved unable to secure
the delivery of the promised foodstuffs
to the Central Powers. Owing to
the resistance of the population only
3,000,000 poods (pood, 36 pounds) were
delivered to the Teutons, instead of
30,000,000 poods, which the Rada undertook
to supply. The Germans then withdrew
their support. According to various
<a class="pagenum" id="page_454" title="pg 454"> </a>
reports, the German agents took
an active part in the overthrowing of the
Rada.</p>

<p>Speaking of the fall of the Rada, the
German Vice Chancellor said that "stubborn
adherence to communistic theories
that have gained no sympathy among
the peasant population, which is attached
to the soil, seems to have been principally
responsible for bringing about its
end." One of the first acts of the new
Government was the restoration of private
ownership of land. The new r&eacute;gime
has many features of an autocratic rule.
The following information regarding the
extent of the Hetman's powers is furnished
by the German Service of Propaganda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Government power in its entire
capacity belongs to the Hetman for all
the territory of the State. The Hetman
ratifies the laws, he appoints the President
of the Council of Ministers, he is
chief director of the relations of foreign
affairs of the Ukrainian State, he is Generalissimo
of the army and of the navy,
he declares war, proclaims martial law
and exceptional laws. In the administration
of justice he has the right of pardon
and commutation of sentence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has been pointed out that, while
the reconstructed Ukrainian Government
is emphatically and avowedly pro-German,
some of its leading spirits are Russian
patriots and advocates of a union
with Russia. Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich
is said to have taken an active part
in the coup d'&eacute;tat. A dispatch, dated May
10, announced the beginning of peace
negotiations between Russia and the
Ukraine.</p>

<h3>GERMAN PENETRATION</h3>

<p>United States Minister Morris at
Stockholm cabled to the State Department
on May 14:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Swedish press reports from Moscow
state that Count von Mirbach recently
transmitted to the Commissariat of the
People a note formulated as an ultimatum
and demanding the immediate effecting of
certain financial measures which would
practically make Russia a German colony.
The chief points of the note were the immediate
solution of the question regarding
the exchange of prisoners, the complete
abolishment of armaments, and the
dissolution of units formed recently; also
the occupation of Moscow and some other
large Russian cities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the same date it was reported from
Moscow that the Germans had captured
Rostov-on-Don, thus gaining control of
the Caucasus, the grain districts in the
Donnetz Basin, and the coal, iron, and
oil fields. Northern Russia was thus cut
off from the Caucasus, excepting for a
single railroad running through Tsaritsin,
in the southern part of the Government
of Saratov, which the Germans
were threatening.</p>

<p>The dispatch continued as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Governmental power in its entire
Government, with which it had made
peace, is regarded by North Russia as a
step toward its occupation. Within a
few weeks the future of Petrograd and
Moscow probably will be determined, as
it is considered that the Soviet Government
either must submit to German domination
or retreat eastward and prepare
for a defense against the invaders. Effective
resistance will be difficult without
outside assistance, because of the lack
of technical experts and supplies. The
bitter feeling against Germany is intensified
by the ruthless seizures in Ukraine,
and a growing disposition to accept allied
aid if the Entente Allies will recognize the
Bolshevist Government is evident.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>RUSSIA'S LOSSES</h3>

<h2>More Bolshevist Legislation</h2>

<h3>By Abraham Yarmolinsky</h3>

<p class="drop">Speaking on Dec. 5, 1917, before
the Central Executive Committee
of the Soviets on the subject of the
right of constituents to recall their
representatives, Nikolai Lenine, the head
of the proletarian Government of Russia,
made the following remark: "The
State is an institution for coercion.
Formerly it was a handful of money-bags
that outraged the whole nation.
We, on the contrary, wish to transform
the State into an institution of coercion
which must do the will of the
people. We desire to organize violence
in the name of the interests of the
toilers." The April issue of <span class="smcap">Current
History Magazine</span> contained a general
outline of the manner in which the makers
of the social revolution applied this
principle of Statehood to the solution of
various problems of home government.
The present article will deal more in detail
with some of the acts of the Bolshevist
legislators. There is no better way
of gaining an insight into the views and
intentions of the present rulers of Russia
than to study the abundant output of
their legislative machinery.</p>

<h3>CONTROLLING PRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Lenine's Government has worked out
an elaborate scheme of State control over
national production and distribution as
a preliminary step toward the complete
socialization of the country's industry
and commerce. The semi-legislative,
semi-executive organs created for that
purpose form an intricate hierarchy of
affiliated elective bodies and corporations
of a large and ill-defined jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In the first place, there have been instituted
so-called Soviets of Workmen's
Control, (decree of Nov. 27, 1917.) These
are made up of representatives of trade
unions, factory committees, and productive
co-operatives, and aim at regulating
the economic life of industrial
plants using hired labor, the control in
each enterprise being effected through
the elective bodies of the workmen, together
with the representatives of the
salaried employes. The executive organs
of the Soviets of Workmen's Control have
the right to fix the minimum output of
a given firm, to determine the cost of
the articles produced, to inspect the books
and accounts, and, in general, to supervise
the production and the various business
transactions. Commercial secrecy, like
diplomatic secrecy, is abolished. The
owners and controlling agencies are responsible
to the State for the safety of
the property and for the strictest order
and discipline within the precincts of the
establishments. The local Soviets are
subordinated to provincial Soviets of
Workmen's Control, which issue local
regulations, take up the complaints of
the owners against the controlling agencies,
and settle the conflicts between the
latter.</p>

<p>The Central All-Russian Soviet of
Workmen's Control issues general instructions
and co-ordinates the activities
of this controlling system with the efforts
of the other administrative organs
regulating the economic life of the country.</p>

<p>The members of this central institution
of control, together with representatives
from each Commissariat (Ministry
of State) and also expert advisers, form
the Supreme Soviet (Council) of National
Economy, instituted by the decree of Dec.
18, 1917. This body directs and unifies
the work of regulating the national economy
and the State finances. It is empowered
to confiscate, requisition, sequestrate,
and syndicate various establishments
in the field of production, distribution,
and State finances. The Supreme
Council is divided into several sections,
each of which deals with a separate
economic phase. Among other tasks devolving
upon these sections is the drafting
of the law projects for the respective
Commissariats. Bills affecting national
economy in its entirety are brought before
the Council of the People's Commissaries
<a class="pagenum" id="page_456" title="pg 456"> </a>
through the Supreme Council of National
Economy.</p>

<h3>ECONOMIC REGULATION</h3>

<p>On Jan. 5, 1918, the Institute of Local
Soviets of National Economy was created,
"for the purpose of organizing and regulating
the economic life of each industrial
section in accordance with the national
and local interests." Affiliated with the
local Soviets of Workmen's and Soldiers'
Delegates, they are subject to the authority
of the Supreme Council of National
Economy. They are made up of representatives
from trade unions, factory
committees, workmen's co-operatives,
land committees, and the technical personnel
of industrial and commercial establishments.
The inner organization of
these bodies is elaborate. There are sections,
divisions, (of organization, supply
and distribution, labor, and statistics,)
and business offices.</p>

<p>Here are some of the functions of these
Soviets. They must:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. Manage the private enterprises confiscated
by the State and given over to the
workmen, such as, for instance, a number
of factories in the Ural mining district.</p>

<p>2. Determine the amount of fuel, raw
materials, machinery, means of transportation,
labor, &amp;c., needed by the given industrial
section, and the amount available
in it.</p>

<p>3. Provide for the economic needs of the
section.</p>

<p>4. Distribute the orders for goods among
the individual enterprises and work out the
basis for the distribution of labor, raw
material, machinery, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. Regulate transportation in the section.</p>

<p>6. See to it that all the productive forces
should be fully utilized both in industry
and agriculture.</p>

<p>7. Improve the sanitary conditions of
labor.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>LAND COMMITTEES</h3>

<p>The activity of the Soviets of National
Economy is restricted to the field of
industry. Their counterpart in agriculture
are the so-called land committees.</p>

<p>The decree relating to agrarian socialization,
voted by the Bolsheviki at 2 A.
M., Nov. 8, 1917, recommends the use of
a certain <i>nakaz</i>, (mandate,) based on 242
resolutions passed by village communities,
as a guide in putting the land reform
into practice. Article 8 of this
<i>nakaz</i>, which is a paraphrase of the
agrarian program of the Social Revolutionists,
reads thus: "All the land, upon
confiscation, forms a national agrarian
fund. The distribution of the land
among the toilers is taken care of by
local and central self-governing bodies.
* * * The land is periodically redistributed,
with the growth of population
and the rise of the productivity of agricultural
labor."</p>

<p>For the purpose of putting this program
into operation and regulating the
economic life of the village generally
there have been instituted land committees,
(decree of Nov. 16,) one for each
volost, (rural district including several
villages.) They are to be elected by the
population of the district and exist as
separate institutions, or function as an
organ of the volost zemstvo, wherever
this is found. The duties of a land committee
are many and complex. It takes
inventory of all the land in the district
and allots to each village its share of
plow land, meadows, and pastures, seeing
to it that the land should be equitably
distributed among the individual toilers
and correctly tilled. It grants lease of
lands and waters, not subject to distribution,
receives the rent and turns it over
to the national fund. It regulates the
supply and demand of agricultural labor,
takes charge of the forests, fixes prices
of timber, receives and fills orders for
fuel from the State, and takes the necessary
measures to preserve the large,
scientifically conducted agricultural establishments.</p>

<p>The delegates of a number of volost
land committees, together with representatives
of the local zemstvo and the
Soviet of Workmen's and Soldier's Delegates,
form a county committee. The
latter, in its turn, sends a delegate to
the Provincial Land Committee. The
Main Land Committee, which heads the
whole system, is an independent institution
on a par with the central State organizations.
It is a large group of people,
consisting of the Commissariat of
Agriculture, together with representatives
from the following bodies: The
Commissariats of Finance, Justice, and
Internal Affairs, the provincial Land
<a class="pagenum" id="page_457" title="pg 457"> </a>
Committees, the All-Russian Soviet of
Peasants' Deputies, the All-Russian
Soviet of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates,
and the political parties.</p>

<h3>NO MORE LANDLORDS</h3>

<p>The Bolsheviki have been careful to
extend the abolition of private land ownership
to city real estate. By a special
decree they abrogated the property
rights in city land and in those of the
city buildings whose value, together with
that of the ground they occupy, exceeds
a certain minimum, fixed in each municipality
by the local authorities, or which
are regularly let for rent, although their
value does not exceed the minimum. The
land and the buildings are declared public
property. The dispossessed owners
retain the right to use the apartment
they occupy in their former property,
provided the apartment is worth no more
than 800 rubles of rent per annum. In
case the value of the apartment exceeds
this maximum the former owner pays
the difference to the local Soviet of
Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates. All
the rent which formerly went to the
landlord is now paid to that institution
or to the Municipal Council. Not more
than one-third of the sum thus collected
is to be used to meet the various needs
of the community; 10 per cent. of it goes
to the national housing fund; the rest
forms the local housing fund for erecting
new buildings, laying out streets, and
making other improvements.</p>

<h3>COMPULSORY INSURANCE</h3>

<p>Municipal socialization of land values,
while manifestly intended to benefit the
poorer classes, directly affects all the
elements of the city population. Other
measures enacted by the Bolsheviki are
restricted to the proletariat, and properly
belong to the field of specific labor
legislation. Thus, a law has been passed
limiting the working day in both industrial
and commercial establishments to
eight hours, and further regulating the
work of women and children. Furthermore,
a minimum wage of the hired
workers has been fixed in each section
of the country. But by far the most
radical and characteristic innovations
launched by the Bolshevist Government
in this line of legislation are those relating
to compulsory insurance of workmen.</p>

<p>On Dec. 29 there was created the
Institute of Insurance Soviets, with an
executive organ in the form of a Chamber
of Insurance. It is the intention of
the Government to introduce compulsory
insurance for laborers against sickness,
unemployment, invalidism, and accidents.
The regulations published so far relate
only to the first two forms of insurance.
The respective decrees rule that throughout
the territory of the Russian Republic
all hired workers, without distinction of
sex, age, religion, nationality, race, and
allegiance, are to be insured against sickness
and unemployment, irrespective of
the character and duration of their work.
Salaried employes and members of liberal
professions are not subject to this regulation.</p>

<p>At the moment the workman is hired
by the employer he automatically becomes
a member of two fraternities. In
the event of his illness, one furnishes
him free medical aid and a weekly allowance
equal to his wages; the other assures
him the equivalent of his wages if
he loses his employment and becomes an
unemployed workman. The latter term
the law defines as "any able-bodied person
depending for subsistence chiefly
upon the wages of his (or her) labor,
who is unable to find work at the normal
rate of remuneration fixed by the proper
trade union, and who is registered in a
local labor exchange or trade union."
The workmen contribute no dues to the
fraternities. The income of the latter
consists mainly of the payments made by
the employers. The owner of an establishment
using hired labor must contribute
each week to the health insurance
fraternity 10 per cent. of the sum he
pays out as wages, and at least 3 per
cent. of the same sum to the unemployment
insurance fraternity. The administrative
machinery of this novel form of
insurance is worked out with much detail.</p>

<p>It is natural to ask how the various
institutions described above are working,
if they are functioning at all. It is
<a class="pagenum" id="page_458" title="pg 458"> </a>
clear that the smooth working of a great
number of cumbersome and wholly novel
administrative agencies in a body politic
torn by an unprecedented social upheaval
amid the horrors of a twofold
war would be little short of a miracle.
Moreover, it appears that the Bolsheviki
have already grown disappointed in
some of their political dogmas, notably
in the unrestrained and ubiquitous application
of the elective principle. Nevertheless,
the query, in its entirety, can
hardly be adequately answered at present.
The time is not far off, however,
when it will be possible to say whether
the measures decreed in the name of the
dictatorial will of the Russian proletariat
have taken root or&mdash;and this alternative
is more probable&mdash;whether they have remained
merely codified day-dreams.</p>

<h2>Lithuania's Efforts Toward Autonomy</h2>

<h3>By A. M. Martus</h3>

<p class="drop">In the press of the United States on
May 4, 1918, there appeared a notice
that President Wilson had given
audience to the Lithuanian delegation,
recognizing the Lithuanians as a distinctively
separate race having rights of
self-determination.</p>

<p>At the time of the upheavals in Russia,
during the Russo-Japanese war in 1905,
Lithuanians, irrespective of political affiliations,
held a convention in their
capital, Vilna, over 2,000 delegates participating,
where they unanimously asserted
their right of self-government;
also expressing a strong desire to form
one political body with their half-brothers,
the Letts.</p>

<p>Again in October, 1917, a convention
was held in Vilna with about 250 delegates
from those parts of Lithuania occupied
by German forces, to press their
claim of independence for Lithuania. In
January, 1918, representative Lithuanians
assembled in the same city proclaimed
independent Lithuania. Another
convention of Lithuanian representatives
from Russia and from Lithuanian communities
in the United States, England,
and Argentina, held in the same month in
Stockholm, Sweden, approved the act of
their countrymen under German domination.
On March 13 and 14 American
Lithuanians held a convention in New
York City, giving their unanimous approval
to the proclaiming of an Independent
Lithuanian Republic; here a
unanimous resolution was passed protesting
against any Polish aspirations or
claims to Lithuania, and demanding the
inclusion of the Lithuanian part of East
Prussia, with the old Lithuanian city of
Karaliauchus (K&ouml;nigsberg,) in the Lithuanian
Republic.</p>

<p>Lithuanians claim those parts of the
neighboring provinces where their language
is spoken and where the inhabitants
consider themselves Lithuanians.
They claim the eastern part of East
Prussia&mdash;about 13,500 square miles, with
700,000 or 800,000 inhabitants&mdash;and parts
of the provinces of Minsk and Vitebsk;
thus the Lithuanian-Lettish Republic
would stretch over 131,000 square miles
and have a population of over 11,500,000,
inhabiting five centres&mdash;Karaliauchus,
(K&ouml;nigsberg,) Klaipeda, (Memel,) Libau,
Windau, and Riga.</p>

<p>The country is very rich for agriculture,
though it contains much undeveloped
land, with many rivers, lakes,
and large forests. Along the River Nieman
in Druskeniki, Government of
Goodns, and in Birchtany, Government
of Vilna, there are salt springs of high
healing qualities, but on account of a
corrupt Russian Government they remain
undeveloped and unexploited. The
seabeach around Palanga, a little distance
above Germany's border on the
Baltic, could be turned into another Atlantic
City, according to the opinion of
experts, but the place remains neglected.
Lithuania's soil is very rich in aluminium
and in material for manufacturing glass.
During my last visit to Lithuania, in 1914,
the discovery of radium was reported in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_459" title="pg 459"> </a>
the vicinity of the mineral springs at
Birchtany, but the war came on very
soon and nothing further was heard of it.</p>

<p>In March, 1918, Lithuanians demanded
that Germany recognize their Provisional
Government. The Tevyne of New York,
official organ of the Lithuanian Alliance
of America, received the following from
its correspondent in Russia, relayed from
Yokohama, March 26:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Lithuania there has been formed a
Provisional Government consisting of the
following: A. Smetona, Premier; P.
Dovydailis, Minister of Education; J.
Shaulys, Minister of Foreign Affairs; M.
Smilgevichus, Minister of Finances; M.
Birzhishka, Minister of Justice; J.
Vileishis, Minister of Public Works; D.
Malinauskas, Minister of Public Safety.
Dr. J. Shlupas, well known among American
Lithuanians, has been appointed Envoy
Plenipotentiary to the United States;
J. Aukshtuolis, President of the Lithuanian
Committee in Stockholm, is made
Ambassador to the Scandinavian countries;
M. Ychas, member of the last Russian
Duma, Ambassador to England and
France; J. Gabrys, manager of the Lithuanian
Information Bureau in Switzerland,
Ambassador to the Central Powers. A
national army is being organized. Lithuania's
absolute neutrality was proclaimed.
Drafted a political and economic treaty
with Sweden.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lithuanians fought in the Russian
Army against the Germans, and now
large numbers of them are joining the
military and naval forces of the United
States to fight the common foe; some are
already in the English Army. Lithuania
has suffered not for her own faults, but
because she was situated between two
belligerents. In the Government of
Suvalki the German and Russian Armies
chased each other nine times backward
and forward; one may imagine how much
is left there. Nothing but excavations,
trenches, heaps of ruins, crumbling chimneys
indicate where previously were
large and prosperous villages. The world
is yet to hear more about German requisitions,
German devastations, and German
rapine in Lithuania. Not only forests
were denuded, but even fruit trees on
the farms were cut down and shipped to
Germany. The remaining inhabitants
are forced to raise crops for the invaders,
and for their various products they must
accept, under penalty, specially printed
money for local use&mdash;money that Germans
themselves would not accept.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding reports to the contrary,
the Lithuanians were with the
Allies all the time, and will stand by them
to the end. They have faith that the
Allies, when the proper time comes, will
recognize their just claims.</p>

<hr class="brk" />

<h3>Germany to Impose "War Burdens" on Lithuania</h3>

<p>Emperor William on May 12, 1918,
issued the following proclamation regarding
Lithuania:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We, Wilhelm, by God's grace German
Emperor, King of Prussia, &amp;c., hereby
make known that, whereas the Lithuanian
Landsrat, as the recognized representative
of the Lithuanian people, on Dec.
12 announced the restoration of Lithuania
as an independent State allied to
the German Empire by an eternal, steadfast
alliance, and by conventions chiefly
regarding military matters, traffic, customs,
and coinage, and solicited the help
of the German Empire; and,</p>

<p>Whereas, further, Previous political connections
in Lithuania are dissolved, we
command our Imperial Chancellor to declare
Lithuania on the basis of the aforementioned
declarations of the Lithuanian
Landsrat, in the name of the German Empire,
as a free and independent State, and
we are prepared to accord the Lithuanian
State the solicited help and assistance in
its restoration.</p>

<p>We assume that the conventions to be
concluded will take the interests of the
German Empire into account equally with
those of Lithuania, and that Lithuania
will participate in the war burdens of
Germany, which secured her liberation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lithuanian National Council, with
headquarters at Washington, replied to
the foregoing proclamation on May 14 as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The assumption that Lithuania "will
participate in the war burdens of Germany"
means a contribution of three
things: Money, munitions, and men. The
first we have not, as Germany has already
impoverished us; the second, we
have no means of supplying, because we
lack the first. Therefore, Germany can
have reference only to men. Men from
a self-declared democracy to fight in the
ranks of autocracy? Unthinkable. Lithuania
would not consent. Are her citizens
to be dragooned into the ranks of the
Kaiser? This would be an abridgment
<a class="pagenum" id="page_460" title="pg 460"> </a>
of the sovereignty which Germany has
already recognized, for Chancellor von
Hertling's reply stated, "We hereby
recognize Lithuania as free and independent."</p>

<p>Germany knows that ultimate defeat is
unavoidable, but she would compensate
losses in the west with gains in the east,
among which Lithuania is gambled on as
an asset. No recognition of Lithuanian
independence can be sincere when coupled
with the von Hertling terms, but if
this sop will add to Prussian man power
it may postpone somewhat the inevitable
day of reckoning and give her more time
to Germanize in the east with a view of
confederating the new republics under
Junker rule.</p>

<h2>The Raid on Zeebrugge and Ostend</h2>

<h3>British Naval Exploit That Damaged Two German
U-Boat Bases on the North Sea Coast</h3>

<p class="drop">The little Belgian port of Zeebrugge
fell into German hands in the
Autumn of 1914, and, with the
neighboring port of Ostend, became
a thorn in the side of the Entente
by reason of its increasing use as a base
for enemy destroyers, submarines, and
aircraft. The Germans, having seized
the shipbuilding plants at Antwerp, began
building submarines and small war
craft, which could be sent by way of
Bruges down the canals that connect the
latter city with Zeebrugge and Ostend.
Especially useful to them was the maritime
canal whose mouth at Zeebrugge
was protected by a crescent-shaped
mole, thirty feet high, inclosing the
harbor.</p>

<p>On the night of April 22-23, 1918, a
British naval expedition under Vice Admiral
Sir Roger Keyes, commanding at
Dover, aided by French destroyers, undertook
to wreck the stone mole at Zeebrugge
and to block the entrances to the
canals both at Zeebrugge and at Ostend
by sinking the hulks of old ships in the
channels. The episode, marked as it was
by heroic fighting, proved to be one of
the most thrilling and picturesque in the
naval operations of the war. To Americans
it recalled Hobson's exploit with the
Merrimac at Santiago, while to Englishmen
it brought back memories of Sir
Francis Drake and his fireships in the
Harbor of Cadiz.</p>

<p>Though the fighting at Zeebrugge lasted
<a class="pagenum" id="page_461" title="pg 461"> </a>
only an hour, the British lost 588 men,
officially reported as follows: Officers&mdash;Killed,
16; died of wounds, 3; missing, 2;
wounded, 29. Men&mdash;Killed, 144; died of
wounds, 25; missing, 14; wounded, 355.</p>

<p>Six obsolete British cruisers took part
in the attack. They were the Brilliant,
Iphigenia, Sirius, Intrepid, Thetis, and
Vindictive. The first five of these were
filled with concrete and were to be sunk
in the entrances of the two ports. The
Vindictive, working with the two Mersey
ferryboats Daffodil and Iris, carried
storming and demolition parties to the
Zeebrugge mole. The object was to attack
the enemy forces and guns on the
mole, along with the destroyer and submarine
depots and the large seaplane
base upon it, and thus to divert the
enemy's attention from the work of the
block ships. As the attack on the mole
accomplished this, the main object of the
operation was successful.</p>

<p>The attacking forces were composed
of bluejackets and Royal Marines picked
from the Grand Fleet and from naval
and marine depots. Sir Eric Geddes
stated in Parliament the next morning
that light forces belonging to the Dover
command and Harwich forces under Admiral
Tyrwhitte covered the operation
from the south. A large force of monitors,
together with many motor launches
and small, fast craft took part. One of
the essentials of success was the creation
of a heavy veil of artificial fog or smoke.
The officer who developed this phase of
the attack was killed in action. The general
plan was to attack the guns and
works on the Zeebrugge mole with storming
parties, while the concrete-laden
cruisers were being sunk in the channel.
Two old and valueless submarines filled
with explosives were to be blown up
against the viaduct connecting the mole
with the shore.</p>

<h3>STORY OF THE FIGHTING</h3>

<p>A detailed narrative of the affair was
issued by the British Admiralty on the
25th, the essential passages of which are
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The night was overcast and there was a
drifting haze. Down the coast a great
searchlight swung its beam to and fro in
the small wind and short sea. From the
Vindictive's bridge, as she headed in toward
the mole, with the faithful ferryboats
at her heels, there was scarcely a glimmer
of light to be seen shoreward. Ahead, as
she drove through the water, rolled the
smoke screen, her cloak of invisibility,
wrapped about her by small craft. This
was the device of Wing Commander Brock,
without which, acknowledges the Admiral
in command, the operation could not have
been conducted.</p>

<p>A northeast wind moved the volume of
it shoreward ahead of the ships. Beyond
it was the distant town, its defenders unsuspicious.
It was not until the Vindictive,
with bluejackets and marines standing
ready for landing, was close upon the
mole that the wind lulled and came away
again from the southeast, sweeping back
the smoke screen and laying her bare to
eyes that looked seaward.</p>

<p>There was a moment immediately afterward
when it seemed to those on the ships
as if the dim, coast-hidden harbor exploded
into light. A star shell soared aloft,
then a score of star shells. The wavering
beams of the searchlights swung around
and settled into a glare. A wild fire of
gun flashes leaped against the sky, strings
of luminous green beads shot aloft, hung
and sank. The darkness of the night was
supplemented by a nightmare daylight of
battle-fired guns and machine guns along
the mole. The batteries ashore awoke to
life.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Landing on the Mole</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>It was in a gale of shelling that the Vindictive
laid her nose against the thirty-foot
high concrete side of the mole, let go
her anchor and signaled to the Daffodil
to shove her stern in.</p>

<p>The Iris went ahead and endeavored to
get alongside likewise. The fire was intense,
while the ships plunged and rolled
beside the mole in the seas, the Vindictive
with her greater draught jarring against
the foundations of the mole with every
lunge. They were swept diagonally by
machine-gun fire from both ends of the
mole and by the heavy batteries on shore.</p>

<p>Commander (now Captain) Carpenter
conned the Vindictive from the open bridge
until her stern was laid in, when he took
up his position in the flame thrower hut
on the port side. It is marvelous that
any occupant should have survived a minute
in this hut, so riddled and shattered
is it.</p>

<p>The officers of the Iris, which was in
trouble ahead of the Vindictive, describe
Captain Carpenter as handling her like a
picket boat. The Vindictive was fitted
along her port side with a high false deck,
from which ran eighteen brows or gangways
by which the storming and demolition
parties were to land.</p>

<p>The men gathered in readiness on the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_462" title="pg 462"> </a>
main lower decks, while Colonel Elliott,
who was to lead the marines, waited on
the false deck just abaft the bridge. Captain
Halahan, who commanded the bluejackets,
was amidships. The gangways
were lowered, and they scraped and rebounded
upon the high parapet of the
mole as the Vindictive rolled in the sea-way.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>
<p>The word for the assault had not yet
been given when both leaders were killed,
Colonel Elliott by a shell and Captain
Halahan by machine-gun fire which swept
the decks. The same shell that killed
Colonel Elliott also did fearful execution
in the forward Stokes mortar battery.
The men were magnificent; every officer
bears the same testimony.</p>

<p>The mere landing on the mole was a
perilous business. It involved a passage
across the crashing and splintering gangways,
a drop over the parapet into the
field of fire of the German machine guns
which swept its length, and a further
drop of some sixteen feet to the surface of
the mole itself. Many were killed and
more wounded as they crowded up the
gangways, but nothing hindered the orderly
and speedy landing by every gangway.</p>

<p>Lieutenant H. T. C. Walker had his arm
shot away by shell on the upper deck, and
lay in darkness while the storming parties
trod him under. He was recognized and
dragged aside by the commander. He
raised his remaining arm in greetings.
"Good luck to you," he called as the rest
of the stormers hastened by. "Good
luck."</p>

<p>The lower deck was a shambles as the
commander made the rounds of the ship,
yet those wounded and dying raised themselves
to cheer as he made his tour. * * *</p>

<h3>Heroic Work on the Iris</h3>

<p>The Iris had troubles of her own. Her
first attempts to make fast to the mole
ahead of the Vindictive failed, as her
grapnels were not large enough to span
the parapet. Two officers, Lieut. Commander
Bradford and Lieutenant Hawkins,
climbed ashore and sat astride the
parapet trying to make the grapnels fast
till each was killed and fell down between
the ship and the wall. Commander Valentine
Gibbs had both legs shot away and
died next morning. Lieutenant Spencer,
though wounded, took command and refused
to be relieved.</p>

<p>The Iris was obliged at last to change
her position and fall in astern of the
Vindictive, and suffered very heavily from
fire. A single big shell plunged through
the upper deck and burst below at a point
where fifty-six marines were waiting for
the order to go to the gangways. Forty-nine
were killed. The remaining seven
were wounded. Another shell in the ward-room,
which was serving as a sick bay,
killed four officers and twenty-six men.
Her total casualties were eight officers
and sixty-nine men killed and three officers
and 103 men wounded.</p>

<p>Storming and demolition parties upon
the mole met with no resistance from
the Germans other than intense and unremitting
fire. One after another buildings
burst into flame or split and crumbled
as dynamite went off. A bombing
party working up toward the mole extension
in search of the enemy destroyed
several machine-gun emplacements, but
not a single prisoner rewarded them. It
appears that upon the approach of the
ships and with the opening of fire the
enemy simply retired and contented themselves
with bringing machine guns to the
short end of the mole.</p>

<h3>BLOCKING THE CANAL</h3>

<p>Describing operations of the three
block ships, the official narrative says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Thetis came first, steaming into a
tornado of shells from great batteries
ashore. All her crew, save a remnant
<a class="pagenum" id="page_463" title="pg 463"> </a>
who remained to steam her in and sink
her, already had been taken off her by a
ubiquitous motor launch, but the remnant
spared hands enough to keep her
four guns going. It was hers to show
the road to the Intrepid and the Iphigenia,
which followed. She cleared a string of
armed barges which defends the channel
from the tip of the mole, but had the ill-fortune
to foul one of her propellers upon
a net defense which flanks it on the shore
side.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>
<p>The propeller gathered in the net, and it
rendered her practically unmanageable.
Shore batteries found her and pounded
her unremittingly. She bumped into the
bank, edged off, and found herself in the
channel again still some hundreds of yards
from the mouth of the canal in practically
a sinking condition. As she lay she signaled
invaluable directions to others, and
her commander, R. S. Sneyd, also accordingly
blew charges and sank her. Motor
launches under Lieutenant H. Littleton
raced alongside and took off her crew.
Her losses were five killed and five
wounded.</p>

<p>The Intrepid, smoking like a volcano
and with all her guns blazing, followed.
Her motor launch had failed to get alongside
<a class="pagenum" id="page_464" title="pg 464"> </a>
outside the harbor, and she had men
enough for anything. Straight into the
canal she steered, her smoke blowing
back from her into the Iphigenia's eyes,
so that the latter was blinded, and, going
a little wild, rammed a dredger, with her
barge moored beside it, which lay at the
western arm of the canal. She was not
clear, though, and entered the canal pushing
the barge before her. It was then
that a shell hit the steam connections of
her whistle, and the escape of steam
which followed drove off some of the
smoke and let her see what she was
doing.</p>

<h3>Main Object Attained</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Stuart Bonham Carter, commanding
the Intrepid, placed the nose of
his ship neatly on the mud of the western
bank, ordered his crew away, and blew up
his ship by switches in the chart room.
Four dull bumps were all that could be
heard, and immediately afterward there
arrived on deck the engineer, who had
been in the engine room during the explosion,
and reported that all was as it
should be.</p>

<p>Lieutenant E. W. Bullyard Leake, commanding
the Iphigenia, beached her according
to arrangement on the eastern
side, blew her up, saw her drop nicely
across the canal, and left her with her
engines still going, to hold her in position
till she should have bedded well down on
the bottom. According to the latest reports
from air observation, two old ships,
with their holds full of concrete, are lying
across the canal in a V position, and it
is probable that the work they set out to
do has been accomplished and that the
canal is effectively blocked. A motor
launch, under Lieutenant P. T. Deane,
had followed them in to bring away the
crews and waited further up the canal
toward the mouth against the western
bank.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bonham Carter, having sent
away his boats, was reduced to a Carley
float, an apparatus like an exaggerated
lifebuoy with the floor of a grating.
Upon contact with the water it ignited a
calcium flare and he was adrift in the uncanny
illumination with a German machine
gun a few hundred yards away giving
him its undivided attention. What
<a class="pagenum" id="page_465" title="pg 465"> </a>
saved him was possibly the fact that the
defunct Intrepid still was emitting huge
clouds of smoke which it had been worth
nobody's while to turn. He managed to
catch a rope, as the motor launch started,
and was towed for awhile till he was observed
and taken on board.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>THE VINDICTIVE'S STORY</h3>

<p>Commander Alfred F. B. Carpenter,
who commanded the Vindictive and who
was made Captain for his successful
work, gave an Associated Press correspondent
an interesting description of
the episode. During the attack he was
at the end of the bridge in a small steel
box or cabin which had been specially
constructed to house a flame thrower.
The Captain, with his arm in a sling,
standing on the shell-battered deck of
the Vindictive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly according to plan we ran alongside
the mole, approached it on the port
side, where we were equipped with specially
built buffers of wood two feet wide.
As there was nothing for us to tie up to,
we merely dropped anchor there, while the
Daffodil kept us against the mole with
her nose against the opposite side of our
ship. In the fairly heavy sea two of our
three gangways were smashed, but the
third held, and 500 men swarmed up this
on to the mole. This gangway was two
feet wide and thirty feet long. The men
who went up it included 300 marines and
150 storming seamen from the Vindictive,
and fifty or so from the Daffodil. They
swarmed up the steel gangway, carrying
hand grenades and Lewis guns. No Germans
succeeded in approaching the gangway,
but a hard hand-to-hand fight took
place about 200 yards up the mole toward
the shore.</p>

<p>The Vindictive's bow was pointed toward
the shore, so the bridge got the full effect
of enemy fire from the shore batteries.
One shell exploded against the pilot house,
killing nearly all its ten occupants. Another
burst in the fighting top, killing a
Lieutenant and eight men, who were doing
excellent work with two pompoms and
four machine guns.</p>

<p>The battery of eleven-inch guns at the
end of the mole was only 300 yards away,
and it kept trying to reach us. The shore
batteries also were diligent. Only a few
German shells hit our hull, because it was
well protected by the wall of the mole,
but the upper structure, mast, stacks,
and ventilators showed above the wall and
were riddled. A considerable proportion
of our casualties were caused by splinters
from these upper works.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Daffodil continued to
push us against the wall as if no battle
was on, and if she had failed to do this
none of the members of the landing party
would have been able to return to the
ship.</p>

<p>Twenty-five minutes after the Vindictive
had reached the wall the first block ship
passed in and headed for the canal. Two
others followed in leisurely fashion while
we kept up the fight on the mole. One of
the block ships stranded outside of the
canal, but the two others got two or three
hundred yards inside, where they were
successfully sunk across the entrance.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes after the Vindictive arrived
alongside the mole our submarine
exploded under the viaduct connecting the
mole with the mainland. The Germans
had sent a considerable force to this viaduct
as soon as the submarine arrived,
and these men were gathered on the viaduct,
attacking our submersible with machine
guns. When the explosion occurred
the viaduct and Germans were blown up
together. The crew of the submarine,
consisting of six men, escaped on board a
dinghy to a motor launch.</p>

<p>Early in the fighting a German shell
knocked out our howitzer, which had been
getting in some good shots on a big German
seaplane station on the mole half a
mile away. This is the largest seaplane
station in Belgium. Unfortunately, our
other guns could not be brought to bear
effectively upon it. The shell which disabled
the howitzer killed all the members
of the gun crew. Many men were also
killed by a German shell which hit the
mole close to our ship and scattered fragments
of steel and stone among the marines
assembling on the deck around the
gangway.</p>

<p>Half an hour after the block ships went
in, we received the signal to withdraw.
The Vindictive's siren was blown, and the
men returned from all parts of the mole
and thronged down the gangway. We
put off after having lain alongside just
about an hour. The Germans made no
effort to interfere with our getaway
other than to continue their heavy firing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>RESCUE FROM BLOCK SHIPS</h3>
<p>
One of the most thrilling incidents was
the rescue by two American-built motor
launches of nearly 200 members of the
crews of two block ships sunk at the entrance
to the Bruges Canal. The feat
was accomplished under a heavy fire and
the actual transfer was made in less
than five minutes. One launch delivered
ninety-nine men to the destroyer.</p>

<p>The dead and wounded could not all be
brought away, but the loss of personnel
in this way was declared to be remarkably
small.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_466" title="pg 466"> </a></p>

<p>Stoker Bendall of the submarine which
blew up the Zeebrugge mole said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was silent and heavy business. We
were going full tilt when we hit the viaduct.
It was a good jolt, and we ran
right into the middle of the viaduct and
stuck there, as we intended to do. I don't
think anybody said anything except,
"Well, we are here all right."</p>

<p>We lowered a skiff and stood by while
the commander touched off the fuse and
then tumbled into the skiff and pushed
off. By bad luck the propeller fouled the
exhaust pipe and left us with only two
oars and two minutes to get away. The
enemy lights were on us, and the machine
guns were firing from the shore.</p>

<p>Before we made 200 yards the submarine
went up, and there was a tremendous
flash and roar, and lots of concrete from
the mole fell around us. Luckily, we were
not struck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Photographs taken from an airplane a
few days later showed that the effort to
block the canal entrance had been successful.
The Intrepid and Iphigenia had
reached the precise positions in which
they were intended to be sunk, while the
exploded submarine had blown a gap of
sixty to a hundred feet in the shore end
of the mole. The Frankfurter Zeitung,
in commenting on the affair, said: "It
would be foolish to deny that the British
fleet scored a great success through a
fantastically audacious stroke in penetrating
into one of the most important
strongholds over which the German flag
floats."</p>

<h3>ATTACKS AT OSTEND</h3>

<p>At Ostend the operations on the same
night were unsuccessful, largely owing
to a shift of wind. Small craft with
smoke apparatus ran in according to
program, set up a screen, and lit two
large flares to mark the entrance to the
harbor for the two concrete-laden cruisers
that were to be sunk in the channel.
Before the cruisers could arrive, however,
the wind shifted and blew away the
smoke screen, after which the German
gunfire quickly destroyed the flares. The
cruisers tried to proceed by guesswork
under heavy fire, but their efforts were
in vain. One of the block ships was sunk,
but not in a position to obstruct the
channel.</p>

<p>A second attempt to close the Ostend
harbor was made on the night of May
9-10, when the battered old Vindictive,
which had borne the brunt of the shellfire
at the Zeebrugge mole, was sunk in
the channel with her inside full of concrete.
A member of the expedition gave
this account:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the Vindictive neared Ostend it became
apparent that the Germans had got
wind of our presence, for suddenly there
was a regular pyrotechnic display of star
shells. The effect was brilliant, but quite
undesirable from our point of view. Immediately
guns of all sizes opened fire
on us, and there was a terrific din.</p>

<p>The Vindictive and one or two other
vessels received hits, and a few casualties
were caused by this gunfire. The firing
was heavily returned by our ships. Most
of the crew of the Vindictive were taken
off when the ship was at a little distance
from the Ostend piers, only a few officers
and men being left to navigate her between
the piers and sink her there. A
motor launch which was assisting in picking
up the crew was hit several times by
shellfire, and was in a sinking condition
when it came alongside the Admiral's
vessel, the destroyer Warwick, to which
they were transferred. The motor launch
had extensive damage in the fore part,
and by order of the Admiral was sunk,
as it was apparent that it could not get
back to Dover. There was a heavy explosion
when the Vindictive sank between
the piers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The casualties in the second Ostend
raid were forty-seven, of whom eighteen
were killed or missing, the rest wounded.</p>

<hr />

<p>The British Admiralty, in its official
report of the second Ostend action, issued
May 14, stated that the Vindictive
was "lying at an angle of about 40
degrees to the pier, and seemed to be
hard fast." Commander Godsal, who
was on deck during the critical moments,
was missing and was believed to have
been killed; Lieutenant Crutchley blew
up the auxiliary charges in the forward
6-inch magazine from the conning tower.
Lieut. Commander William A. Bury,
who blew up the main charges by a
switch installed aft, was severely wounded.
The Admiralty reported that the
sunken ship would make the harbor impracticable
for any but small craft and
difficult for dredging operations.

<h2>German U-Boat Claims</h2>

<h3>Address by Admiral von Capelle</h3>

<p class="center small"><i>German Naval Secretary</i></p>

<p class="drop">Admiral Von Capelle, the German
Secretary of the Navy, delivered
an address before the
Reichstag, April 17, 1918, in which
he asserted that the submarine warfare
of Germany was a success. In the course
of his speech he said:</p>

<p>"The main question is, What do the
western powers need for the carrying on
of the war and the supply of their homelands,
and what amount of tonnage is
still at their disposal for that purpose?
All statistical calculations regarding tonnage
are today almost superfluous, as the
visible successes of the U-boat war
speak clearly enough. The robbery of
Dutch tonnage, by which the Anglo-Saxons
have incurred odium of the worst
kind for decades to come, is the best
proof of how far the shipping shortage
has already been felt by our opponents.
In addition to the sinkings there must
be added a great amount of wear and
tear of ships and an enormous increase
of marine accidents, which Sir J. Ellerman,
speaking in the Chamber of Shipping
recently, calculated at three times
the peace losses. Will the position of the
western powers improve or deteriorate?
That depends upon their military achievements
and the replacing of sunken ships
by new construction."</p>

<p>Dealing briefly with Sir Eric Geddes's
recent speech on the occasion of the debate
on the naval estimates, Admiral von
Capelle declared:</p>

<p>"The assertion of the First Lord of the
Admiralty that an unwillingness to put
to sea prevailed among the German
U-boat crews is a base calumny."</p>

<h3>LOSSES AND CONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p>As regards the assertions of British
statesmen concerning the extraordinarily
great losses of U-boats, Admiral von Capelle
said:</p>

<p>"The statements in the foreign press
are very greatly exaggerated. Now, as
before, our new construction surpasses
our losses. The number of U-boats, both
from the point of view of quality and
quantity, is constantly rising. We can
also continue absolutely to reckon on our
military achievements hitherto attained.
Whether Lloyd George can continue
the naval war with prospects of success
depends, not upon his will but upon the
position of the U-boats as against shipbuilding.
According to Lloyd's Register,
something over 22,000,000 gross register
tons were built in the last ten years before
the war in the whole world&mdash;that is,
inclusive of the construction of ourselves,
our allies, and foreign countries. The
entire output today can in no case be
more, for difficulties of all kinds and the
shortage of workmen and material have
grown during the war. In the last ten
years&mdash;that is, in peace time&mdash;800,000
gross register tons of the world's shipping
was destroyed annually by natural
causes. Now in wartime the losses,
as already mentioned, are considerably
greater. Thus, 1,400,000 gross register
tons was the annual net increase for the
entire world. That gives, at any rate, a
standard for the present position. America's
and Japan's new construction is to
a certain extent destined for the necessities
of these countries.</p>

<p>"In the main, therefore, only the figures
of British shipbuilding come into
question. About the middle of 1917 there
was talk of 3,000,000 tons in official
quarters in Great Britain. Then Lloyd
George dropped to 2,000,000, and now,
according to Bonar Law's statement,
the output is 1,160,000 tons. As
against, therefore, about 100,000 tons
monthly put into service there are sinkings
amounting to 600,000 tons, or six
times as much. In brief, if the figures
given are regarded as too favorable and
new construction at the rate of 150,000
tons monthly&mdash;that is, 50 per cent. higher&mdash;be
assumed, and the sinkings be reduced
to 450,000 tons, then the sinkings
<a class="pagenum" id="page_468" title="pg 468"> </a>
are still three times as large as the
amount of new construction.</p>

<h3>THE COMING MONTHS</h3>

<p>"One other thing must especially be
taken into consideration for the coming
months. Today every ship sunk strikes
at the vital nerve of our opponents. Today,
when only the absolutely necessary
cargoes of foodstuffs and war necessities
can still be transported, the sinking of
even one small ship has quite a different
significance as compared with the beginning
of the U-boat war. Moreover, the
loss of one ship means a falling out of
four to five cargoes. In these circumstances
even the greatest pessimist must
say that the position of our opponents is
deteriorating in a considerably increasing
extent and with rapid strides, and
that any doubt regarding the final success
of the U-boat war is unjustified."</p>

<p>Replying to a question of the reporter,
Admiral von Capelle said:</p>

<p>"Our opponents have been busily endeavoring
to strengthen their anti-submarine
measures by all the means at
their disposal, and, naturally, they have
attained a certain success. But they
have at no time had any decisive influence
on the U-boat war, and, according
to human reckoning, they will not do so
in the future. The American submarine
destroyers which have been so much
talked about have failed. The convoy
system, which, it is true, offers ships a
certain measure of protection, has, on
the other hand, also the great disadvantage
of reducing their transport capabilities.
The statements oscillate from
25 to 60 per cent.</p>

<p>"For the rest, our commanders are specially
trained for attacks on convoys, and
no day goes by when one or more ships
are not struck out of convoys. Experienced
commanders manage to sink three
to four ships in succession belonging to
the same convoy."</p>

<h3>THE STEEL QUESTION</h3>

<p>Admiral von Capelle then dealt with
the steel question as regards shipbuilding,
which, he said, "is practically the
determinative factor for shipbuilding."
He continued:</p>

<p>"Great Britain's steel imports in 1916
amounted to 763,000 tons, and in 1917
only amounted to 497,000 tons. That
means that already a reduction of
37 per cent. has been effected, a reduction
which will presumably be further
considerably increased during 1918. Restriction
of imports of ore from other
countries, such as America, caused by
the U-boat war will also have a hampering
effect on shipbuilding in Great Britain.
It is true that Sir Eric Geddes denied
that there was a lack of material,
but expert circles in England give the
scarcity of steel as the main reason for
the small shipbuilding output.</p>

<p>"American help in men and airplanes
and American participation in the war
are comparatively small. If later on
America wants to maintain 500,000 troops
in France, shipping to the amount of
about 2,000,000 tons would be permanently
needed. This shipping would have
to be withdrawn from the supply service
of the Allies.</p>

<p>"Moreover, according to statements made in the United States and Great
Britain, the intervention in the present campaign of such a big army no longer
comes into consideration. After America's entry into the war material help for
the Entente has not only not increased, but has even decreased considerably.
President Wilson's gigantic armament program
has brought about such economic
difficulties that America, the export
country, must now begin to ration instead
of, as it was hoped, increasingly to
help the Entente. To sum up, it can be
stated that the economic difficulties of
our enemies have been increased by
America's entry into the war."</p>

<h3>"ENGLAND'S DANGER POINT"</h3>

<p>Later in the debate Admiral von Capelle
said: "The salient point of the discussion
is the economic internal and political
results of the U-boat war during
the coming months. The danger point for
England has already been reached, and
the situation of the western powers grows
worse from day to day."</p>

<p>Admiral von Capelle then briefly dealt
with that calculation of the world tonnage
made by a Deputy which received
<a class="pagenum" id="page_469" title="pg 469"> </a>
some attention in the Summer of last
year. "This calculation," he said, "shows
a difference of 9,000,000 tons from
the calculation of the Admiralty Staff.
In my opinion, the calculation of the Admiralty
Staff is correct. Whence otherwise
comes the Entente's lack of tonnage,
which, in view of the facts, cannot be
argued away? The Admiralty Staff in
its calculation adapted itself to the fluctuating
situation of the world shipping.
At first each of the enemy States looked
after itself. Later, under Great Britain's
leadership, common control of tonnage
was established."</p>

<p>Admiral von Capelle quoted the calculation
of the American Shipping Department,
according to which the world tonnage
in the Autumn of 1917 amounted to
32,000,000, of which 21,000,000 were
given as transoceanic. He insisted, however,
that so much attention must not be
paid to all these calculations, but exhorted
the people rather to dwell on the joyful
fact that the danger point for the
western powers had been reached.</p>

<p>At the close of the sitting Admiral von
Capelle stated that all orders for the
construction of U-boats had been given
independently by the Naval Department
and that the Naval Administration had
never been instructed to give orders for
more U-boats by the Chancellor or the
Supreme Army Command. Every possible
means, he said, for the development
of U-boat warfare had been done by the
Naval Department.</p>

<p>Admiral von Capelle in a supplemental
statement before the Reichstag,
May 11, in discussing the naval estimates,
said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reports for April are favorable.
Naturally, losses occur, but the main thing
is that the increase in submarines exceeds
the losses. Our naval offensive is stronger
today than at the beginning of unrestricted
submarine warfare. That gives
us an assured prospect of final success.</p>

<p>The submarine war is developing more
and more into a struggle between U-boat
action and new construction of ships.
Thus far the monthly figures of destruction
have continued to be several times
as large as those of new construction.
Even the British Ministry and the entire
British press admit that.</p>

<p>The latest appeal to British shipyard
workers appears to be especially significant.
For the present the appeal does
not appear to have had great success.
According to the latest statements British
shipbuilding fell from 192,000 tons in
March to 112,000 in April; or, reckoned in
ships, from 32 to 22. That means a decline
of 80,000 tons, or about 40 per cent. [The
British Admiralty stated that the April
new tonnage was reduced on account of
the vast amount of repairing to merchantmen.&mdash;Editor.]</p>

<p>America thus far has built little, and
has fallen far below expectations. Even
if an increase is to be reckoned with in
the future, it will be used up completely
by America herself.</p>

<p>In addition to the sinkings by U-boats,
there is a large decline in cargo space
owing to marine losses and to ships becoming
unserviceable. One of the best-known
big British ship owners declared
at a meeting of shipping men that the
losses of the British merchant fleet
through marine accidents, owing to conditions
created by the war, were three
times as large as in peace.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Admiral's Statements Attacked</h3>

<p>The British authorities asserted that
Admiral von Capelle's figures were misleading
and untrue. The losses published
in the White Paper include marine
risk and all losses by enemy action.
They include all losses, and not merely
the losses of food ships, as suggested in
the German wireless message dated April
16. Even in the figures of the world's
output of shipbuilding von Capelle seems
to have been misled. He states that
"something over 2,000,000 gross tons
were built annually in the last ten years,
including allied and enemy countries."
The actual figures are 2,530,351 gross
tons. He further states that the entire
output today can in no case be more,
owing to difficulties in regard to labor
and material. The actual world's output,
as shown in the Parliamentary White
Paper, excluding enemy countries,
amounted to 2,703,000 gross tons,
and the output is rapidly rising. Von
Capelle tried to raise confusion with regard
to the figures 3,000,000 and 2,000,000
tons and the actual output for 1917.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_470" title="pg 470"> </a>
The Admiralty says no forecast was
ever given that 3,000,000 tons, or even
2,000,000 tons, would be completed in that
year. Three million tons is the ultimate
rate of production, which, as the First
Lord stated in the House of Commons,
is well within the present and prospective
capacity of United Kingdom shipyards
and marine engineering works. The exaggerated
figures of losses are still relied
on by the enemy. The average loss
per month of British ships during 1917,
including marine risk, was 333,000 gross
tons, whereas Secretary von Capelle in
his statement bases his argument on an
average loss from submarine attacks
alone of 600,000 tons per month. The
figures for the quarter ended March 31,
1918, showed British losses to be 687,576
tons, and for the month of March 216,003
tons, the lowest during any month, with
one exception, since January, 1917. With
regard to steel, the First Lord has already
assured the House of Commons
that arrangements have been made for
the supply of steel to give the output
aimed at, and at the present time the
shipyards are in every case fully supplied
with the material.</p>

<p>The American production of new tonnage
reached its stride in May, and the
estimate of over 4,000,000 tons per annum
was regarded as conservative. It
was estimated that the total British and
American new tonnage in the year ending
May, 1919, would exceed 6,000,000,
as against total U-boat sinkings, based
on the record of the first quarter of 1918,
of 4,500,000.</p>

<h3>The Month's Submarine Record</h3>

<p>The British Admiralty, in April, 1918,
discontinued its weekly report of merchant
ships destroyed by submarines or
mines, and announced that it would publish
a monthly report in terms of tonnage.
These figures are shown in the
table above. The last weekly report
was for the period ended April 14, and
showed that eleven merchantmen over
1,600 tons, four under 1,600 tons, and
one fishing vessel had been sunk.</p>

<p>In regard to the sinkings in April,
French official figures showed that the
total losses of allied and neutral ships,
including those from accidents at sea during
the month, aggregated 381,631 tons.</p>

<p>Norway's losses from the beginning
of the war to the end of April, 1918,
amounted to 755 vessels, aggregating
1,115,519 tons, and the lives of 1,006
seamen, in addition to about 700 men
on fifty-three vessels missing, two-thirds
of which were declared to be war losses.</p>

<p>The American steamship Lake Moor,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_471" title="pg 471"> </a>
manned by naval reserves, was sunk by
a German submarine in European waters
about midnight on April 11, with a loss
of five officers and thirty-nine men. Five
officers and twelve enlisted men were
landed at an English port. Eleven men,
including five navy gunners, were lost
when the Old Dominion liner Tyler was
sunk off the French coast on May 3.
The Canadian Pacific Company's steamer
Medora also was sunk off the French
coast. The Florence H. was wrecked in
a French port by an internal explosion
on the night of April 17. Out of the
crew of fifty-six men, twenty-nine were
listed as dead or missing, twelve were
sent to hospital badly burned, two were
slightly injured, and only thirteen escaped
injury. Of the twenty-three men
of the naval guard only six were reported
as survivors.</p>

<p>Six officers and thirteen men were
reported missing as the result of two
naval disasters reported on May 1 by
the British Admiralty. They formed
part of the crews of the sloop Cowslip,
which was torpedoed and sunk on April
25, and of Torpedo Boat 90, which
foundered.</p>

<p>According to Archibald Hurd, a British
authority on naval matters, the
area in the North Sea which was proclaimed
by the British Government as
dangerous to shipping and therefore
prohibited after May 15 is the
greatest mine field ever laid for the
special purpose of foiling submarines.
It embraces 121,782 square miles, the
base forming a line between Norway and
Scotland, and the peak extending northward
into the Arctic Circle.</p>

<h2>A Secret Chapter of U-Boat History</h2>

<h3>How Ruthless Policy Was Adopted</h3>

<p><i>The causes that led to Germany's adoption of the policy of unrestricted submarine
warfare on Feb. 1, 1917, were revealed a year later by the Handelsblad, an
Amsterdam newspaper, whose correspondent had secured secret access to "a number
of highly interesting and important documents" long enough to read them and
make notes of their contents. The Dutch paper vouched for the accuracy of the following
information:</i></p>

<p class="drop">At the close of the year 1915 the
German Admiralty Staff prepared
a semi-official memorandum to
prove that an unrestricted submarine
campaign would compel Great Britain
to sue for peace "in six months at the
most." The character of the argument
conveys the impression that the chiefs
of the German Admiralty Staff had already
made up their minds to adopt the
most drastic measures in regard to submarine
warfare, but that they wished
to convince the Kaiser, the Imperial
Chancellor, and the German diplomatists
of the certainty of good results on economic
and general, rather than merely
military, grounds. To this end the
memorandum based its arguments on
statistics of food prices, freight, and insurance
rates in Great Britain. It pointed
out that the effects on the prices of essential
commodities, on the balance of
trade, and, above all, on the morale of the
chief enemy, had been such, even with
the restricted submarine campaign of
1915, that, if an unrestricted submarine
war were decided upon, England could
not possibly hold out for more than a
short period.</p>

<p>The memorandum was submitted to
the Imperial Chancellor, who passed it
on to Dr. Helfferich, the Secretary of
State for Finance. He, however, rejected
the document on the ground that,
in the absence of authentic estimates of
stocks, it was impossible to set a time-limit
to England's staying power, and
also that he was exceedingly doubtful as
to what line would be taken by neutrals,
especially the United States. Dr. Helfferich
maintained that so desperate a
remedy should only be employed as a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_472" title="pg 472"> </a>
last resource. The authors of the memorandum
then sent a reply, in which they
developed their former arguments, and
pointed to the gravity of the internal
situation in Germany. They emphasized
the importance of using the nearest and
sharpest weapons of offense if a national
collapse was to be avoided. They reinforced
their argument by adducing the
evidence of ten experts, representing
finance, commerce, the mining industry,
and agriculture. They were Herr Waldemar
M&uuml;ller, the President of the Dresdner
Bank; Dr. Salomonsohn of the Disconto
Gesellschaft; Dr. Paul Reusch of
Oberhausen, Royal Prussian Councilor
of Commerce; Dr. Springorum of Dortmund,
Chancellor of Commerce, member
of the Prussian Upper House, (Herren
Haus,) General Director of Railways
and Tramways at Hoesch, an ironmaster,
and a great expert in railways; Herr
Max Schinkel of Hamburg, President of
the Norddeutsche Bank in Hamburg and
of the Disconto Gesellschaft in Berlin;
Herr Zuckschwerdt of Madgeburg, Councilor
of Commerce, late member of the
Prussian Upper House; Herr Wilhelm von
Finck of Munich, Privy Councilor, chief
of the banking house of Merck, Finck &amp;
Co., Munich; Councilor of Economics R.
Schmidt of Platzhof, member of the
W&uuml;rttemberg Upper Chamber and of the
German Agricultural Council; Herr
Engelhard of Mannheim, Councilor of
Commerce, President of the Chamber of
Commerce and member of the Baden
Upper Chamber.</p>

<p>These experts were invited to send
answers in writing to the three following
questions: (1) What would be the
effect on England of unrestricted submarine
warfare? (2) What would be its
effect on Germany's relations with the
United States and other neutrals?
(3) To what extent does the internal
situation in Germany demand the use of
this drastic weapon?</p>

<p>The reader will do well to remember
that the replies were written in February,
1916&mdash;nearly two years ago. All
agreed on the first point&mdash;the effect on
Great Britain. The effect of unrestricted
submarine warfare on England
would be that she would have to sue for
peace in six months at the most. Herr
M&uuml;ller, who seemed to be in a position
to confirm the statistics given in the
memorandum, pointed out that the supply
of indispensable foodstuffs was, at
the time of writing, less than the normal
supply in peace time. He held that the
submarine war, if relentlessly and vigorously
pursued, would accomplish its purpose
in less time than calculated in the
memorandum&mdash;in fact, three months
should do it. Dr. Salomonsohn also
thought that six months was an excessive
estimate, and that less time would
suffice.</p>

<p>On the question of the effect on neutrals
the experts were divided. Dr.
Reusch suggested that the neutrals despised
the restricted submarine warfare
of 1915, and held that every ship in
British waters, whether enemy or neutral,
should be torpedoed without warning.
According to him, the world only
respects those who, in a great crisis,
know how to make the most unscrupulous
use of their power.</p>

<p>Herr M&uuml;ller predicted that ruthless
submarine war would cause a wholesale
flight of neutrals from the war zone.
Their newspapers might abuse Germany
at first, but they would soon get tired.
The danger was from the United States,
but that would become less in proportion
as Germany operated more decisively
and ruthlessly. Dr. Salomonsohn adopted
the same attitude. He recognized the
possibility of war with the United States,
but was loath to throw away so desirable
a weapon on that account.</p>

<p>As to the third point, all the experts
agreed that the internal situation in Germany
demanded that the most drastic
methods of submarine warfare should be
employed. Herr Zuckschwerdt urged the
advisability of the most drastic measures
owing to the feeling of the nation. The
nation would stand by the Government,
but not if it yielded to threats from
America. Such weakness would lead to
serious consequences. Herr Schmidt admitted
the possibility of Germany not
being able to hold out, and emphasized
the importance of taking drastic steps
before disorder and unrest arose in the
agricultural districts.

<h2>Sea-Raider Wolf and Its Victims</h2>

<h3>Story of Its Operations</h3>

<p><i>A third chapter of sea-raider history similar to those of the M&ouml;we and Seeadler
was revealed when the Spanish steamship Igotz Mendi, navigated by a German prize
crew, ran aground on the Danish coast, Feb. 24, 1918, while trying to reach the Kiel
Canal with a cargo of prisoners and booty. The next day the German Government
announced that the sea-raider Wolf, which had captured the Igotz Mendi and ten
other merchant vessels, with 400 prisoners, had successfully returned after fifteen
months in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. The story of the Wolf's operations,
as gleaned by Danish and English correspondents from the narratives of released
prisoners, is told below. Some of the most interesting passages were furnished
by Australian medical officers who had been captured on the British steamer
Matunga:</i></p>

<p class="drop">The Wolf, a vessel of about 6,000
gross tonnage, armed with several
guns and torpedo tubes, carried a
seaplane, known as the Wolfchen,
which was frequently used in the operations
of the sea raider. On some days
the seaplane made as many as three
flights. The Wolf, apparently, proceeded
from Germany to the Indian
Ocean, laying minefields off the Cape,
Bombay, and Colombo. Early in February,
1917, she captured the British
steamship Turritella, taking off all the
officers and putting on board a prize
crew which worked the vessel with her
own men. In every case of capture,
when the vessel was not sunk at once,
this procedure was adopted.</p>

<p>The Wolf transferred a number of
mines to the Turritella, with instructions
that they should be laid off Aden. A
few days later the Turritella encountered
a British warship, whereupon the prize
crew, numbering twenty-seven, sank the
Turritella, and were themselves taken
prisoner.</p>

<p>Three weeks later the Wolf overhauled
the British steamer Jumna. The Wolf
thought that the British vessel was
about to ram her, and the port after-gun
was fired before it was properly trained,
killing five of the raider's crew and
wounding about twenty-three others.
The Jumna remained with the Wolf for
several days, after which her coal and
stores were transferred to the raider,
and she was sunk with bombs. The next
vessels to be captured and sunk were
the British steamships Wordsworth and
Dee.</p>

<p>Early in June the Wolf, while at
anchor under the lee of an island in the
Pacific, sighted the British steamship
Wairuna, bound from Auckland, N. Z.,
to San Francisco with coal, Kauri gum,
pelts, and copra. The Wolf sent over
the seaplane which, flying low, dropped
a canvas bag on the Wairuna's deck,
containing the message, "Stop immediately;
take orders from German
cruiser. Do not use your wireless or I
will bomb you." The Wairuna eased
down, but did not stop until the seaplane
dropped a bomb just ahead of her. By
this time the Wolf had weighed anchor
and proceeded to head off the Wairuna.
A prize crew was put on board with orders
to bring the ship under the lee of the
island and anchor. All the officers, except
the master, were sent on board the
Wolf. The following day possibly a
thousand tons of cargo were transferred.</p>

<h3>CAPTURE OF THE MATUNGA</h3>

<p>While the two vessels were anchored,
the chief officer and second engineer of
the Turritella let themselves over the
side of the Wolf with the intention of
swimming ashore. Later, the Wairuna
was taken out and sunk by gunfire, the
bombs which had been placed on board
having failed to accomplish their purpose.
The next captures were the
American vessels, Winslow, Beluga, and
Encore, which were either burned or
sunk.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_474" title="pg 474"> </a></p>

<p>For nearly a week following this the
Wolf hove to, sending the seaplane up
several times each day for scouting purposes.
Apparently she had picked up
some information by her wireless apparatus
and was on the lookout for a
vessel. On the third day the Wolfchen
went up three times, and, on returning
from its last flight, dropped lights.
Early the next morning none of the
prisoners was allowed on deck. A gun
was fired by the Wolf, and it was afterward
found that it was to stop the
British steamer Matunga, with general
cargo and passengers, including a number
of military officers and men.</p>

<h3>BETRAYED BY WIRELESS</h3>

<p>It was on the morning of Aug. 5, when
the Matunga was nearing the coast of
the territory formerly known as German
New Guinea, that she fell in with the
Wolf, which was mistaken for an ordinary
tramp steamer, as the two vessels
ran parallel to each other for about
two miles. Then the Wolf suddenly revealed
her true character by running up
the German flag, dropping a portion of
her forward bulwarks, exposing the muzzles
of her guns, and firing a shot across
the bows of the Matunga. At the same
time the Wolf sent a seaplane to circle
over the Matunga at a low altitude for
the obvious purpose of ascertaining
whether the latter was armed. Apparently
satisfied with the seaplane's report,
the German Captain sent a prize
crew, armed with bayonets and pistols,
to take possession of the British ship.
Before their arrival, however, all the
Matunga's code books, log books, and
other papers were thrown overboard.
During the time the prize crew, all of
whom spoke English well, were overhauling
the Matunga, it was learned that
the Germans had been lying in wait for
her for five days, as they had somehow
learned that she was carrying 500 tons
of coal, which they needed badly, and
that the German wireless operator had
been following her course from the time
of her departure from Sydney toward
the end of July.</p>

<p>The two ships, now both under German
command, proceeded together to a
very secluded natural harbor on the north
coast of Dutch New Guinea, the entrance
to which was watched by two German
guard boats, while a wireless plant was
set up on a neighboring hill and the
Wolf's seaplane patrolled the sea around
for about 100 miles on the lookout for
any threatened danger. The two ships
remained in the Dutch harbor for nearly
a fortnight, during which time the Wolf
was careened and her hull scraped of
barnacles and weeds in the most thorough
and methodical manner, after which
the coal was transferred from the Matunga's
bunkers. The latter vessel was
then taken ten miles out to sea, where
everything lying loose was thrown into
the hold and the hatches battened down
to obviate the possibility of any floating
wreckage remaining after she was sunk.
Bombs were then placed on board and
exploded, and the Matunga went down
in five or six minutes without leaving a
trace.</p>

<p>Before the Matunga was sunk all her
crew and passengers were transferred to
the Wolf, which then pursued a zigzag
course across the Pacific Ocean and
through the China Sea to the vicinity of
Singapore, where she sowed her last
remaining mines. According to stories
told by the crew, they had sown most of
their mines off Cape Town, Bombay,
Colombo, the Australian coast, and in the
Tasman Sea, between Australia and New
Zealand. They also boasted that on one
occasion, when off the coast of New
South Wales, their seaplane made an
early morning expedition over Sydney
Harbor (the headquarters of the British
Navy in the Pacific) and noted the disposition
of the shipping in that port.
They also claimed that the seaplane was
the means of saving the Wolf from capture
off the Australian coast on one
occasion, when she was successful in
sighting a warship in sufficient time to
enable the Wolf to make good her escape.</p>

<p>A week or more was spent by the Wolf
in the China Sea and off Singapore,
whence she worked her way to the Indian
Ocean for the supposed purpose of picking
up wireless instructions from Berlin
and Constantinople.</p>

</div>

<p>On Sept. 26, while still dodging about
<a class="pagenum" id="page_475" title="pg 475"> </a>
in the Indian Ocean, the Wolf met and
captured a Japanese ship, the Hitachi-maru,
with thirty passengers, a crew of
about 100, and a valuable cargo of silk,
copper, rubber, and other goods, for Colombo.
During the previous day the
Germans had been boasting that they
were about to take a big prize, and it
afterward transpired that they based
their anticipations on the terms of a
wireless message which they had intercepted
on that day. When first called
upon by signal to stop, the Japanese commander
took no notice of the order, and
held on his way even after a shot had
been fired across his ship's bow. Thereupon
the Wolf deliberately shelled her,
destroying the wireless apparatus, which
had been sending out S O S signals,
and killing several members of the crew.
While the shelling was going on, a rush
was made by the Japanese to lower the
boats, and a number of both crew and
passengers jumped into the sea to escape
the gunfire. The Germans afterward admitted
to the slaughter of fifteen, but
the Matunga people assert that the death
roll must have been much heavier. The
steamer's funnels were shot away, the
poop was riddled with shot, and the decks
were like a shambles. All this time the
Wolf's seaplane hovered over the Japanese
ship ready to drop bombs upon her
and sink her in the event of any hostile
ship coming in sight.</p>

<p>After transferring the passengers and
crew and as much of the cargo as they
could conveniently remove from the
Hitachi-maru to the Wolf, her decks were
cleared of the wreckage their gunfire
had caused, and a prize crew was put in
charge of her with a view of taking her
to Germany. Some weeks later, however,
that intention was abandoned for
reasons known only to the Germans
themselves, and on Nov. 5 the Hitachi-maru
was sunk.</p>

<h3>IGOTZ MENDI TAKEN</h3>

<p>The Wolf then proceeded on her
voyage, and on Nov. 10 captured the
Spanish steamship Igotz Mendi, with a
cargo of 5,500 tons of coal, of which
the Wolf was in sore need. The raider
returned with this steamer to the island
off which the Hitachi-maru had been
sunk, and one evening all the married
people, a few neutrals and others, and
some sick men were transferred from
the Wolf to the Igotz Mendi. The raider
took aboard a large quantity of coal,
and, after the Spanish vessel had been
painted gray, the two vessels parted
company. The Wolf reappeared on several
occasions and reported that she had
captured and sunk the American sailing
vessel John H. Kirby and the French
sailing vessel Mar&eacute;chal Davout. On
Boxing Day the Wolf attempted to coal
from the Igotz Mendi in mid-Atlantic,
but, owing to a heavy swell, the vessels
bumped badly. It was afterward stated
that the Wolf had been so badly damaged
that she was making water.</p>

<p>A few days later two large steamships
were sighted, and both the Wolf and the
Igotz Mendi hastily made preparations
to escape. The officers and crew
changed their clothes to ordinary seamen's
attire, packed up their kitbags,
and sent all the prisoners below.</p>

<p>Among the latter was the first officer
of the Spanish ship, who saw a German
lay a number of bombs between the
decks of the Igotz Mendi ready to be
exploded if it became necessary to sink
that ship with all her prisoners while
the Wolf looked after her own safety.
These bombs were temporarily left in
the charge of the German wireless operator
to whom the Spanish officer
found an opportunity of communicating
a message to the effect that he was
wanted immediately on the bridge. The
ruse was successful, for the operator
promptly obeyed the instruction, and in
his temporary absence all the bombs
were thrown overboard. The German
commander, Lieutenant Rose, was furious.
He held an investigation next day
and asked each prisoner if he knew anything
about the bombs. When the Spanish
Chief Officer's turn came he answered:</p>

<p>"Yes; I threw them overboard. I'll
tell you why. It was not for me, Captain
Rose, but for the women and little children.
I am not afraid of you. You can
shoot me if you want to, but you can't
drown the little children."
<a class="pagenum" id="page_476" title="pg 476"> </a></p>

<p>Rose confined him to his room, and the
next time the Igotz Mendi met the Wolf,
Commander Nerger sentenced him to
three years in a German military prison.</p>

<p>Coaling having finished, the vessels
proceeded north in company. During
the first week of January the Wolf sank
the Norwegian bark Storkbror, on the
ground that the vessel had been British-owned
before the war. This was the
Wolf's last prize. The last time the two
raiders were together was on Feb. 6,
when the Wolf was supplied with coal
and other requirements from the Igotz
Mendi. Thereafter, each pursued her
own course to Germany.</p>

<h3>RAIDER MEETS DISASTER</h3>

<p>About Feb. 7 the Igotz Mendi crossed
the Arctic Circle, and, encountering much
ice, was forced back. Two attempts were
made at the Northern Passage, but as
the ship was bumping badly against the
ice floes a course was shaped between
Iceland and the Faroes for the Norwegian
coast. On the night of the 18th a
wireless from Berlin announced that the
Wolf had arrived safely. At 3:30 P. M.
on Feb. 24 the Igotz Mendi ran aground
near the Skaw, having mistaken the
lighthouse for the lightship in the foggy
weather. Three hours later a boat came
off from the shore. The Igotz Mendi was
boarded at 8 o'clock by the commander
of a Danish gunboat, who discovered the
true character of the ship, which the
Germans were endeavoring to conceal.</p>

<p>Next day twenty-two persons, including
nine women, two children, and two
Americans, were landed in lifeboats and
were cared for by the British Consul.
Many of them had suffered from inadequate
nourishment in the last five weeks.
There had been an epidemic of beri-beri
and scurvy on board the vessel.</p>

<p>The Danish authorities interned the
German commander of the Igotz Mendi.
The German prize crew refused to leave
the ship.</p>

<p>The Berlin authorities on Feb. 25, 1918,
issued an official announcement containing
these statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The auxiliary cruiser Wolf has returned
home after fifteen months in the Atlantic,
Indian, and Pacific Oceans. The Kaiser
has telegraphed his welcome to the commander
and conferred the Order Pour le
M&eacute;rite, together with a number of iron
crosses, on the officers and crew. The
Wolf was commanded by Frigate Captain
Nerger and inflicted the greatest damage
on the enemy's shipping by the destruction
of cargo space and cargo. She brought
home more than four hundred members
of crews of sunken ships of various nationalities,
especially numerous colored
and white British soldiers, besides several
guns captured from armed steamers and
great quantities of valuable raw materials,
including rubber, copper, brass, zinc,
cocoa beans, copra, &amp;c., to the value of
many million marks.</p>

<h2>Career and Fate of the Raider Seeadler</h2>

<h3>A German Adventure in the Pacific</h3>

<p><i>Fitted out as a motor schooner under command of Count von Luckner, with a
crew of sixty-eight men, half of whom spoke Norwegian, the German commerce
raider Seeadler (Sea Eagle) slipped out from Bremerhaven in December, 1916, encountered
a British cruiser, passed inspection, and later proceeded, with the aid of
two four-inch guns that had been hidden under a cargo of lumber, to capture and destroy
thirteen merchant vessels in the Atlantic before rounding the Horn into the
Pacific and there sinking three American schooners before meeting a picturesque
fate in the South Sea Islands. The narrative of the Seeadler's career as here told
by <span class="smcap">Current History Magazine</span> is believed to be the most complete yet published.</i></p>

<p class="drop">On Christmas Day, 1916, the British
patrol vessel Highland Scot met
and hailed a sailing vessel which
declared itself without ceremony to be
the three-masted Norwegian schooner
Irma, bound from Christiania to Sydney
with a cargo of lumber. As nothing was
more natural, the vessel was allowed to
pass, and soon disappeared on the horizon.</p>

<p>A few days later, in the Atlantic, running
before a northerly gale, this neatlooking,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_477" title="pg 477"> </a>
long-distance freighter threw its
deck load of planks and beams into the
ocean, brought from their hiding places
two four-inch guns, six machine guns,
two gasoline launches, and a motor
powerful enough to propel the vessel
without the use of sails on occasion. Then
a wireless dispatch sent in cipher from
aerials concealed in the rigging announced
that the German raider Seeadler
was ready for business. On the bow the
legend, "Irma, Christiania," and at the
masthead the flag of Norway remained to
lure the raider's victims to destruction.</p>

<p>The Seeadler had formerly been the
American ship Pass of Balmaha, 2,800
tons, belonging to the Boston Lumber
Company. In August, 1915, while on its
way from New York to Archangel, it
was captured by a German submarine
and sent to Bremen, where it was fitted
out as a raider. Under the name of the
Seeadler it left Bremerhaven on Dec. 21,
1916, in company with the M&ouml;we, ran the
British blockade by the ruse indicated
above, and began its career of destruction
on two oceans. While the M&ouml;we waylaid
its twenty-two victims along the
African coast, the Seeadler turned southwest
and preyed on South American
trade.</p>

<p>One by one the Seeadler sent to the
bottom the British ships Gladis Royle,
Lady Island, British Yeoman, Pinmore,
Perse, Horngarth; the French vessels
Dupleix, Antonin, La Rochefoucauld,
Charles Gounod, and the Italian ship
Buenos Aires. On March 7, 1917, it encountered
the French bark Cambronne
two-thirds of the way between Rio de
Janeiro and the African coast and forced
it to take on board 277 men from the
crews of the eleven vessels previously
captured. The Cambronne was compelled
to carry these to Rio de Janeiro,
where it landed them on March 20, thus
first revealing the work of the Seeadler
to the world. On March 22 the German
Government announced the safe completion
of the second voyage of the M&ouml;we.
(See <span class="smcap">Current History Magazine</span> for
May, 1917, p. 298.)</p>

<p>Having thus ended its operations in the
Atlantic, the Seeadler rounded Cape Horn
with the intention of scouring the Pacific.
In June it sank two American
schooners in that ocean, the A. B. Johnson
and R. C. Slade, adding another, the
Manila, on July 8, and making prisoners
of all the crews. Captain Smith of the
Slade afterward told the story of his experiences.
His ship had been attacked
on June 17, and he had at first tried to
escape by outsailing the raider; but after
the ninth shell dropped near his ship he
surrendered. He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They took all our men aboard the raider
except the cook. Next morning I went
back on board with all my men and packed
up. We left the ship with our belongings
June 18. We were put on board the raider
again. Shortly after I saw from the raider
that they cut holes in the masts and placed
dynamite bombs in each mast, and put
fire to both ends of the ship and left her.
I saw the masts go over the side and the
ship was burning from end to end, and
the raider steamed away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After six months of hard life at sea
the raider was in need of repairs and
the crew longed for a rest on solid land.
Casting about for an island sufficiently
isolated for his purpose, the Captain,
Count von Luckner, decided upon the
French atoll of Mopeha, 265 miles west
of Tahiti; he believed the little island to
be uninhabited. The Seeadler dropped
anchor near its jagged coral reefs July
31, 1917. On Aug. 1 Captain von Luckner
took possession of the islet and
raised the German flag over what he
called the Kaiser's last colony. But the
next day, during a picnic which he had
organized "to entertain his crew and
prisoners," leaving only a few men on
board the Seeadler, a heavy swell dropped
the ship across an uncharted blade of
the reef, breaking the vessel's back. The
Germans were prisoners themselves on
their own conquered islet!</p>

<p>Von Luckner had been incorrect in believing
the island entirely uninhabited.
Three Tahitians lived there to make
copra (dried cocoanut) and to raise pigs
and chickens for the firm of Grand, Miller
&amp; Co. of Papeete; this firm was shortly
to send a vessel to take away its employes,
a fact which the Germans learned
with mixed emotions.</p>

<p>They brought ashore everything they
could from their wrecked ship, including
planks and beams, of which they constructed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_478" title="pg 478"> </a>
barracks; also provisions, machine
guns, and wireless apparatus. The
heavy guns were put out of commission&mdash;likewise
the ship's motor. The wireless
plant, a very powerful one, was set
up between two cocoanut trees. It was
equipped with sending and receiving apparatus,
and without difficulty its operator
could hear Pago-Pago, Tahiti, and
Honolulu.</p>

<p>On Aug. 23 Count von Luckner and
five men set out in an armed motor sloop
for the Cook Islands, which they reached
in seven days. There they succeeded in
deceiving the local authorities, but a few
days later they and their boat were captured
in the Fiji Islands by the local constabulary
and handed over to the British
authorities. Thus ended the Captain's
hope of seizing an American ship
and returning to Mopeha for his crew.</p>

<p>On Sept. 5 the French schooner Lutece
from Papeete arrived at Mopeha to get
the three Tahitians and their crops.
First Lieutenant Kling took a motor boat
and a machine gun and captured the
schooner, which had a large cargo of
flour, salmon, and beef, with a supply of
fresh water. Kling and the rest of the
Germans, after dismantling the wireless,
left the island that night, abandoning
forty-eight prisoners, including the
Americans, the crew of the Lutece, and
four natives. Before going they destroyed
what they could not take with
them, cut down many trees to get the
cocoanuts more easily, and left to the
prisoners very scant provisions, and bad
at that. The few cocoanuts that remained
were largely destroyed by the
great number of rats on the island.
There was plenty of fish and turtles.</p>

<p>After the flight of the Germans the
French flag was hoisted on the island
and the twentieth-century Robinson Crusoes
organized themselves under Captain
Southard of the Manila and M. Fain, one
of the owners of the Lutece. The camp
was rebuilt, the supplies rationed out,
the catching of fish and turtles arranged,
and the question of going in search of
help discussed. On Sept. 8 Pedro Miller,
one of the owners of the Lutece, set sail
in an open boat with Captains Southard
and Porutu, a mate, Captain Williams,
and three sailors, hoping to reach the
Island of Maupiti, eighty-five miles to
the east; but after struggling eight days
against head winds and a high sea he returned
to Mopeha with his exhausted
companions. Two days later, Sept. 19,
Captain Smith of the Slade, with two
mates and a sailor, left the island in a
leaky whaleboat dubbed the Deliverer of
Mopeha and shaped their course toward
the west; in ten days they covered 1,080
miles and landed at Tutuila, one of the
Samoan Islands, where the American
authorities informed Tahiti by wireless
of the serious plight of the men marooned
on Mopeha. The British Governor at
Apia&mdash;Robert Louis Stevenson's last
home&mdash;also offered to send a relief ship;
but the Governor of the French Establishments
of Oceania, declining this offer
with thanks, dispatched the French
schooner Tiare-Taporo from Papeete on
Oct. 4.</p>

<p>Two days later the relief expedition
sighted Mopeha by means of a column
of smoke that rose from the island, for
the Robinson Crusoes had organized a
permanent signal system to attract the
attention of passing vessels. The arrival
of the rescuers was greeted with
frantic acclamations. By evening the
last boatload of refugees was aboard the
Tiare-Taporo, and on the morning of Oct.
10 the schooner reached Papeete, where
the prisoners at last were free.</p>

<p>The fate of the Lutece with the main
body of the Seeadler's crew was indicated,
though not fully explained, by a
cable dispatch from Valparaiso, Chile,
March 5, 1918, stating that the Chilean
schooner Falcon had arrived there from
the Easter Islands with fifty-eight sailors
formerly belonging to the crew of the
Seeadler. The sailors were interned by
the Chilean Government. Count Felix
von Luckner, commander of the Seeadler,
who, with five of his men, had been captured
by the local constabulary of the
Fiji Islands, was interned by the British
in a camp near Auckland, New Zealand.
In December he and other interned Germans
escaped to sea in an open boat and
traveled nearly 500 miles, suffering from
lack of food and water, but were recaptured
after a two weeks' chase.

<h2>Treatment of British Prisoners</h2>

<h3>Shocking Brutalities in German War Prisons
Revealed in an Official Report</h3>

<p class="drop">A report issued by an official
British Investigating Committee,
known as the Justice Younger
Committee, appointed to investigate
the treatment of British soldiers by
their German captors, made public in
April, 1918, presents a shocking record
of barbarities. The commission reported
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is now no doubt in the minds of the
committee that as early, at the latest, as the
month of August, 1916, the German Command
were systematically employing their British
as well as other prisoners in forced labor
close behind the western firing line, thereby
deliberately exposing them to the fire of the
guns of their own and allied armies. This
fact has never been acknowledged by the
German Government. On the contrary, it
has always been studiously concealed. But
that the Germans are chargeable, even from
that early date, with inflicting the physical
cruelty and the mental torture inherent in
such a practice can no longer be doubted.</p>

<p>Characteristically the excuse put forward
was that this treatment, not apparently suggested
to be otherwise defensible, was forced
upon the German Command as a reprisal for
what was asserted to be the fact, namely,
that German prisoners in British hands had
at some time or other been kept less than
thirty kilometers (how much less does not
appear) behind the British firing line in
France. This statement was quite unfounded.</p>

<p>Furthermore, at the end of April, 1917, an
agreement was definitely concluded between
the British and German Governments that
prisoners of war should not on either side be
employed within thirty kilometers of the
firing line. Nevertheless, the German Command
continued without intermission so to
employ their British prisoners, under the inhuman
conditions stated in the report. And
that certainly until the end of 1917&mdash;it may
be even until now&mdash;although it has never even
been suggested by the German authorities,
so far as the committee are aware, that the
thirty kilometers limit agreed upon has not
been scrupulously observed by the British
Command in the letter as well as in the spirit.</p>

<h3>"Prisoners of Respite"</h3>

<p>The German excuse is embodied in different
official documents, some of which enter into
detailed descriptions of the reprisals alleged
to be in contemplation because of it. These
descriptions are in substantial accord with
treatment which the committee, from the information
in their possession, now know to
have been in regular operation for months
before either the threat or the so-called excuse
for it, and to have continued in regular
operation after the solemn promise of April
that it should cease. These documents definitely
commit the German Command to at
least a threatened course of conduct for
which the committee would have been slow
to fix them with conscious responsibility. Incidentally
they corroborate in advance the
accuracy, in its incidents, of the information,
appalling as it is, which has independently
reached the committee from so many sides.</p>

<p>As a typical example, the committee set
forth a transcript in German-English of one
of these pronouncements, of which extensive
use was made. It is a notice, entitled, "Conditions
of Respite to German Prisoners." As
here given, it was handed to a British noncommissioned
officer to read out, and it was
read out to his fellow-prisoners at Lille on
April 15, 1917:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon the German request to withdraw
the German prisoners of war to a distance
of not less than thirty kilometers from
the front line, the British Government
has not replied; therefore it has been decided
that all prisoners of war who are
captured in future will be kept as prisoners
of respite. Very short of food, bad
lighting, bad lodgings, no beds, and hard
work beside the German guns, under
heavy shellfire. No pay, no soap for
washing or shaving, no towels or boots,
&amp;c. The English prisoners of respite are
all to write to their relations or persons
of influence in England how badly they
are treated, and that no alteration in the
ill-treatment will occur until the English
Government has consented to the German
request; it is therefore in the interest of
all English prisoners of respite to do their
best to enable the German Government
to remove all English prisoners of respite
to camps in Germany, where they will be
properly treated, with good food, good
clothing, and you will succeed by writing
as mentioned above, and then surely the
English Government will consent to Germany's
request, for the sake of their own
countrymen. You will be supplied with
postcard, note paper, and envelope, and
all this correspondence in which you will
explain your hardships will be sent as express
mail to England.</p>

<h3>Starved to Death</h3>

<p>It seems that the prisoners, from as early
as August, 1916, were kept in large numbers
<a class="pagenum" id="page_480" title="pg 480"> </a>
at certain places in the west&mdash;Cambrai and
Lille are frequently referred to in the evidence&mdash;but
in smaller numbers they were
placed all along the line. Their normal work
was making roads, repairing railways, constructing
light railways, digging trenches,
erecting wire entanglements, making gun-pits,
loading ammunition, filling munition
wagons, carrying trench mortars, and doing
general fatigue work, which under the pain
of death the noncommissioned officers were
compelled to supervise.</p>

<p>This work was not only forbidden by the
laws of war, it was also excessively hard.
In many cases it lasted from eight to nine
hours a day, with long walks to and fro,
sometimes of ten kilometers in each direction,
and for long periods was carried on
within range of the shellfire of the allied
armies. One witness was for nine months
kept at work within the range of British
guns; another for many months; others for
shorter periods. Many were killed by these
guns; more were wounded; deaths from starvation
and overwork were constant. One instance
of the allied shellfire may be given.
In May, 1917, a British or French shell burst
among a number of British and French
prisoners working behind the lines in Belgium.
Seven were killed; four were wounded.</p>

<p>But there is much more to tell. The men
were half starved. Two instances are given
in the evidence of men who weighed 180
pounds when captured. One was sent back
from the firing line too weak to walk, weighing
only 112 pounds; the other escaped to
the British lines weighing no more. Another
man lost twenty-eight pounds in six weeks.
Parcels did not reach these prisoners. In
consequence they were famished. Such was
their hunger, indeed, that we hear of them
picking up for food potato peelings that had
been trampled under foot. One instance is
given of an Australian private who, starving,
had fallen out to pick up a piece of bread left
on the roadside by Belgian women for the
prisoners. He was shot and killed by the
guard for so doing.</p>

<h3>Some Merciful Guards</h3>

<p>It was considered, so it would seem, to be
no less than a stroke of luck for prisoners to
chance upon guards who were more merciful.
For instance, one of them speaking of food
at Cambrai says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it had not been for the French civilians
giving us food as we went along the
roads to and from work we should most
certainly have starved. If the sentries
saw us make a movement out of the
ranks to get food they would immediately
make a jab at us with their rifles, but
conditions here were not so bad as at
Moretz, where if a man stepped out of
the ranks he was immediately shot. I
heard about this from men who had themselves
been working at Moretz, and had
with their own eyes seen comrades of
theirs shot for moving from the ranks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At Ervillers in February, 1917, a prisoner's
allowance for the day consisted of a quarter
of a loaf of German black bread, (about a
quarter of a pound,) with coffee in the morning;
then soup at midday, and at 4:30 coffee
again, without sugar or milk. On this a man
had to carry on heavy work for over nine
hours. The ration of the German soldier at
the same time and place consisted of a whole
loaf of bread per day, good, thick soup, with
beans and meat in it, coffee, jam, and sugar;
two cigars and three cigarettes. The food
conditions at Marquion a little later are thus
described:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We used to beg the sentries to allow us
to pick stinging nettles and dandelions to
eat, we were so hungry; in fact, we were
always hungry, and I should say we were
semi-starved all the time. While we were
here our Sergeants put in for more rations,
but the answer they got was that we were
prisoners of war now "and had no rights
of any kind; that the Germans could work
us right up behind their front lines if they
liked, and put us on half the rations we
were then getting."</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Flogged with Dog Whip</h3>

<p>The ration was coffee and a slice of bread
at 4:45 A. M., soup of barley and horseflesh
at 2 P. M., eight pounds of barley and ten
pounds of meat between 240 men. And they
were compelled to work hard for eight or nine
hours a day on this diet. The frequent
cruelty of the guards generally is a matter
constantly referred to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The German Sergeant in charge at Ervillers
(says one prisoner) was very harsh.
Twice I saw him (this prisoner was there
for a month only) using a dog whip, and
heard of him doing so on another occasion.
He used it mostly on men who
were slow in getting out to work owing
to weakness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The description by a body of these men on
their arrival at a camp in Germany, after
being withdrawn from the front, may be
taken as another example of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We were forced to work; we were given
hardly any food, and when we fell down
from sheer exhaustion we were kicked
until we got up again, and it was not until
we absolutely could not get about that we
were sent back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To add to their miseries, the accommodation
provided for these prisoners was in many
cases pathetically inadequate. The witnesses
recur to this again and again. One sleeping
place, for instance, for a large party was a
barn with no roof. The rain poured in upon
the men. They had to sleep in their wet
clothes and work in the same clothes. They
had no change of any kind. And some of
these prisoners, if they survived so long,
were kept behind these enemy lines for over
a year. Their quarters at Cambrai are thus
described by two of the men:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We slept about twelve in a room in our
<a class="pagenum" id="page_481" title="pg 481"> </a>
uniforms, without either greatcoats or
blankets. There was no fire, and it was
very cold. We lay on loose straw, which
was full of vermin, and we consequently
became verminous. We could only wash
in a bucket of cold water, without either
soap or towels.</p>

<p>The Germans did not supply us with any
clothing, and as we had to work in all
weathers, conditions were very hard.
Our clothes used to get drenched through,
but still we had to go back to barracks
and sleep in them. It was terribly cold
also, especially without our fur coats.
We asked for clothing, but never got any.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>No Parcels or Letters</h3>

<p>But, added to all these hardships, it was
the total absence of parcels and the fact that
letters or communications from their friends
rarely reached them that placed these prisoners,
for misery, in a class apart. Instances
are on record where the very existence of
some of them was undisclosed by their captors
for many months. In March, 1917, for
example, a body of these prisoners who had
been captured as long before as August, 1916,
and had been kept at work by the Germans
behind their lines ever since, were returned
to a parent camp in Germany weak and emaciated.
On arrival there they found a number
of their own names in the lists of missing
men that had been sent from our War Office
through Switzerland and posted in the
camp. * * *</p>

<p>It seems almost incredible, but the committee
do not doubt it to be the fact, that as
late as November, 1917, there were at Limburg-am-Lahn
undelivered between 18,000
and 20,000 parcels for British prisoners on
the German western front. In July, 1917,
the German delegates at The Hague plainly
recognized that no distinction in respect of
the receipt of parcels could be properly made
between prisoners of war in occupied territories
and others. The agreement then concluded
contains provisions on that subject.
Having regard to the condition of things at
Limburg as late as November, 1917, the committee
can only regret that the effect of that
agreement was certainly at that date not so
manifest as it ought to have been. The matter,
they add, is of tragic importance to the
prisoners concerned. It made and makes just
the difference between starvation and existence
to the unfortunate sufferers.</p>

<h3>Extracts from Evidence</h3>

<p>The committee extract from the great mass
of evidence now in their possession statements
as to the impression produced upon
those who actually saw our men upon their
escape to the British lines or after their
transfer to camps in Germany. These statements,
they believe, must convince every impartial
mind that it is impossible in terms of
exaggeration to describe the sufferings these
prisoners had undergone.</p>

<p>In April, 1917, three of them escaped over
"No Man's Land." They were received by
a British General Staff officer, a Major in
the 1st Anzac Corps. This is what he says
of them, under date April 18, 1917:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three men escaped from behind the German
lines to us the other day. They had
been prisoners three months, and were
literally nearly dead with ill-treatment
and starvation. One of them could hardly
walk, and was just a skeleton. He had
gone down from 182 pounds to less
than 112 pounds in three months. I
fetched him back from the line, and it almost
made me cry. All that awful January
and February out all day in the wet
and cold; no overcoat, and at night no
blanket, in a shelter where the clothes
froze stiff on him; no change of underclothing
in three months, and he was one
mass of vermin, no chance of washing.
The bodies of all of them were covered
with sores. "Beaten and starved," one of
them said, "sooner than go through it
again I'd just put my head under the
first railway."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following is the substance of statements
by two witnesses from a German
camp:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>About June, 1917, a party of about twenty
English soldiers came in who had been
working behind the German lines on the
western front. I became friends with one
of them. He was so weak that I have
several times seen him faint on parade.
Another of them told me that he was one
of a party of 100 working behind the lines
on the western front digging trenches and
carrying up supplies. He said they were
all very badly treated and starved. They
were knocked about by the Germans if
they did not march as fast as they wanted
them to, although they were all so weak.
He was only sent to Germany when he
became so weak as to be useless for work.
When I left he did not look as if he could
lift a shovelful of sand. There was another
whom I knew. He had also been
working behind the lines. They had to
work in clogs and no socks. He said they
used to tie rags round their feet. He was
employed on road making. I never could
have believed the things I was told but for
the terrible state the men were in, which
caused me to feel that no horror I was
told was impossible.</p>

<p>Many were brought into the camp who
had returned from working behind the
lines; they were in a shocking state,
literally skin and bones, hardly able to
walk, and quite worn out physically and
mentally; their clothes threadbare and in
rags, without boots, wearing old rag
slippers. They told me that the conditions
of work behind the lines, where
some of them had been for months, were
terrible; they had to work eight hours a
day, and generally were made to walk
ten kilometers out to their work, and the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_482" title="pg 482"> </a>
only food they were given was one cup of
coffee, a slice of bread, and some soup a
day&mdash;a day's ration.</p>

<h3>"Shot at Sight"</h3>

<p>From another camp comes the following
testimony:</p>

<p>In May of this year a large party of
British came into the camp, who had returned
from behind the German lines.
They were ravenous through being
starved, and half savages. I spoke to
several of them. * * * Men were
shot at sight for a slight cause, such
as dropping out to get bread from Belgian
civilians. The state in which they
returned was the worst sight I have seen
in my life. Their clothes were ragged,
they were half shaven, verminous, suffering
from skin diseases, and were half
savage with hunger and bad treatment.
After their arrival the commandant in
the camp issued an order (which I saw)
that no more of these parties should be
taken through the main street of the town,
but should go by the byways on account of
the feeling that had been caused among
the population. I am told that the population
showed a great deal of sympathy,
tears, &amp;c.</p>

<p>About May 1, 1917, about 300 prisoners
of all nationalities were brought from behind
the western lines. I spoke to those
who came into the lazaret. All were
starving, and had been kept there until
they collapsed from overwork. Fifteen
Russians died as soon as they were
brought in. One man told me that on a
march of eleven kilometers a man fell out
ill, the guard gave him so many minutes
to fall in again, and told him he would
shoot him if he was not up by then; he
could not go on, and the guard shot him.</p>

<p>From a third camp:</p>

<p>I knew two of our men who had been
working behind the German lines in the
west for five months. One was 29 years
old, the other 25. The first weighed
180 pounds when captured. He left the
firing line too weak to walk, and weighed
110 pounds. He was badly treated and
knocked about. When I saw him in camp
he was black and blue. The other man
had the same treatment. They were both
starved, and both were gray-headed with
the five months' treatment. These men
said our men were dying there every day
through hardship and exposure. The food
behind the lines was about half the camp
rations.</p>

<h3>"Worked to the Bone"</h3>

<p>From a fourth camp:</p>

<p>In September, 1917, seventy-five noncommissioned
officers, who had been behind
the lines, were brought into our
camp. They were in a bad physical condition,
hungry, lousy, and worked out.
One month after, a large body, all privates
from behind the lines, captured since May,
came in. They were in a terrible condition,
famished beyond words. They had
been worked to the bone, and were in a
filthy condition. They made our camp
lousy. The camp doctor said they were
the worst cases he had seen, and said
they could stay in bed for a week. They
were so famished that two died of eating
the food we gave them. They had been
working on the Hindenburg line, and
the railway Cambrai to Lille, and repairing
it under fire. They said they were on
very small rations and compelled to work.
They told us that Frenchwomen who out
of compassion gave them any trifling gift
of fruit were knocked down by the sentries.
</p>

<p>From the same camp:</p>

<p>I spoke to men who had been kept at
work behind the German lines on the
western front. The majority of these
were there about twelve months, and they
came into camp about the end of November
or the beginning of December, 1917.
They told me that they had been employed
close up to the lines. They had been employed
cutting trees, and had been under
our own shellfire. They were half starved
and in a terrible condition. On one occasion
about 300 came in, about forty of
whom had British clothes, the rest being
dressed in odds and ends of French and
German clothing&mdash;in fact, anything they
could get hold of. We collected bread for
them and cut it up in readiness for their
arrival so as to save all possible time, but
their hunger was so great they could not
help raiding us and fighting for it. It was
terrible to see them. I do not think many
of them had been wounded, but their condition
was so terrible that I cannot describe
it.</p>

<p>They were absolutely the worst bunch
of men I had ever seen. They were terribly
thin and weak, and fell down as
soon as they started to eat, as they were
in an absolutely exhausted state. Their
underclothing was in a dreadful state, and
they were covered with vermin, and had
been like that for about twelve months.
This is the party which I mentioned as
coming to the camp about the end of November
or the beginning of December,
1917. About a fortnight after their arrival,
and after their clothes had been
fumigated and they had baths two or
three times a week, they picked up wonderfully.</p>

<p>From a fifth camp:</p>

<p>In March, 1917, I saw fifty English
prisoners come in to camp who had been
working behind the lines near Cambrai
digging trenches; they had been there
three or four months. All of them were
in a shocking condition, absolutely
starved, with boils and sores all over
<a class="pagenum" id="page_483" title="pg 483"> </a>
them. We used to share our parcels with
these men. During the whole time I was
in camp&mdash;that is, up to December last&mdash;men
were drifting in who had been working
behind the lines on the western front;
they always arrived in the same shocking
condition. I remember particularly one,
in November, 1917, coming back from
Cambrai district. He was very bad and
starved; he told me they had been very
badly treated; all huddled together in
barns, no sanitary arrangements, no blankets,
and he said he had seen a native
woman shot for giving them food; that
they were well within range of guns, and
within six kilometers of the lines, shells
frequently falling about them, and that
he had seen many of his own comrades
wounded while working, that they were
knocked about by their guards, and, generally,
his account of their treatment was
appalling. To my knowledge from conversation
with them, men were coming in
who had been working close up behind the
lines right down to the time I left Germany
in December, 1917.</p>

<p>From an army Chaplain:</p>

<p>On Feb. 16, 1917, there arrived in Minden
Hospital sixteen men who had been
working behind the western front, attached
to Camp E.K. 5. The thermometer
registered 10 degrees, Fahrenheit, below
zero. They had walked seven kilometers
from the station. Their clothing consisted
of tunic, trousers, and thin shirt, boots
and socks, and an old hat&mdash;no coat and
no underclothes. They had been two days
and two nights in the cold train with very
little to eat. * * * Two of these men
died later of consumption in Minden.
They had all been captured in November
(this was February) and their relatives
did not know that they were even alive.
These men report, too, that they are brutally
treated; human life is not worth so
much as horseflesh, because the latter can
be eaten. They are worked until they
either die or so completely collapse that
they are useless. I believe this was the
first party that arrived from the western
front. I had the names of the men in a
notebook, but it was taken from me. They
said it was nothing to wake up in the
morning and find the man sleeping beside
you dead. I got the names of several who
had died, and wrote to their people to inform
them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Lives Made Unbearable</h3>

<p>The committee close these statements with
the following striking extract from the evidence
of a young wounded British officer who
was placed in a ward in a German hospital
in France, filled with prisoners of all nationalities:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The German in charge of the ward was
a university professor, and, seeing several
of our men, also Russians and Rumanians,
come on to the hospital in an emaciated
condition, I asked him the cause, and
where they came from, when, without giving
me details, he told me they came
from working camps behind the lines.
There, he said, the conditions were frightful,
so much so that he himself was
ashamed of them&mdash;the men were overworked,
under shellfire, very much underfed,
had not much clothing, and slept
in sheds and shelters in the snow under
filthy conditions. I ascertained from him
and from some of our own men that many
died behind the lines; all were thoroughly
ill-treated by the Germans, and the lives
of those who did not die were made quite
unbearable.</p>

<p>I am sure the German who informed
me had no personal grounds which made
him complain against the system, it was
merely on humanitarian grounds that he
told me he was shocked; and the independent
stories I received from our own
soldiers simply bore out the fact that
the Germans were ill-treating their prisoners
behind the lines at this time. While
I was in hospital the German I have
mentioned above did his best to get the
men from the hospital marked unfit for
work behind the lines; and I must in fairness
add that as a result very few, if any,
went back to work there once they had
been sent to hospital, and they seemed
to be marked for camps in Germany instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The report concludes: "The committee in
their survey of the evidence dealt with in this
report have failed to find a trace even of lip
service either to the obligations so solemnly
undertaken by the German Government in
time of peace for regulating their conduct in
time of war or to these principles from their
War Book which that Government professed
as their own. Further comment appears to
the committee to be superfluous. The facts
speak for themselves."</p>

<h2>American Prisoners Exploited</h2>

<p class="small"><i>A correspondent sent the following from The Hague, April 20, 1918, regarding
the German treatment of American prisoners:</i></p>

<p class="drop">From irrefutable evidence obtained
by your correspondent, it is impossible
to close one's eyes to what is
going on in the hospitals and prisoners'
camps in Germany. It is a mistake to
believe that the treatment of prisoners
and wounded in Germany has improved.
On the contrary, it is as bad as it ever
was, even worse.</p>

<p>The punishments inflicted are cruel and
inhuman. As is well known, prisoners
are absolutely dependent upon parcels for
food and clothing. A favorite punishment
is to withhold these from a whole camp
or from large bodies of prisoners. It has
been established beyond doubt that prisoners
are employed behind the front and
are under shellfire, in defiance of The
Hague agreement of 1917.</p>

<p>Some prisoners never reach a camp
in Germany for six months, meanwhile
receiving no parcels of food. Their condition
on arrival at camp, broken down
and starving, is pitiable.</p>

<p>The evidence doesn't tend to show that
American prisoners are receiving any
preferential treatment. It is reported
that the first American prisoners taken
were hawked about the country, presumably
to show them off to the populace.
At Giessen, where, it would seem,
American prisoners were kept on two
separate occasions, they were prohibited
any intercourse, even by sign language,
with other prisoners and were not allowed
to receive parcels or gifts from them.</p>

<p>British prisoners at Giessen asked if
they could give parcels to Americans, and
finally received permission to do so the
following day. But the next day the
American prisoners were moved away
early in the morning.</p>

<p>British prisoners were able to detect
Americans who had been captured any
length of time by their appearance and
by the state of their clothes. Until parcels
for them arrived from Berne their
state was deplorable.</p>

<p>A British noncommissioned officer recently
obtained the signatures of the first
ten Americans captured and talked with
them. These men signed the scrap of
paper in the hope that some news of them
would reach the outside world. They
were in poor physical health and somewhat
despondent.</p>

<p>A few recent examples from a large
amount of sworn evidence follow:</p>

<p>In February, 1918, 4,000 men were
sent from a Westphalian camp to within
thirty kilometers behind the front. Their
guards ran away to escape the British
shrapnel fire.</p>

<p>The state of prisoners coming from the
big Somme battle in the first week of
the present month was deplorable. Their
wounds had not been dressed in many
cases for more than ten days. Owing
to the lack of dressing, British comrades
bandaged their wounds with old towels
and shirts.</p>

<p>It was formally announced by the German
authorities in Camp Bonn on April
13 last that two British soldiers, R.
and B., had been shot near Minden
for not stopping talking when ordered to
do so.</p>

<p>In November, 1917, men were brought
into the hospital at M. continually,
having been wounded by shrapnel from
behind the lines. Wounded men lay for
three or four weeks unattended and
grossly neglected.</p>

<p>Much of the sworn evidence is so repugnant
that it could not be published.
There has been talk of reprisals on American
prisoners, and even foreigners born
in America are included in these threatened
reprisals.

<h2>Total Destruction of Rheims</h2>

<h3>By G. H. Perris</h3>

<p class="center small"><i>With the French Armies, April 20, 1918</i></p>

<p class="drop">The great fire at Rheims has nearly
burned itself out. Having thrown
in a week 50,000 explosive and an
unknown number of incendiary and gas
shells, the German gunners ceased as
suddenly and inexplicably as they had begun,
and when I entered the city this
morning the silence of death brooded
over it.</p>

<p>The written word is powerless to
describe such a spectacle, and it is no
more adequate for being unmeasured.
But when men of faith, men who love the
old and beautiful, write under the fresh,
stunning impression of such a sight, is it
strange that some loose phrases escape
them?</p>

<p>I am very familiar with the ruins of
Rheims. From the first bombardment,
which destroyed the exquisite sculptures
of the north tower and the fa&amp;ccedil;ade of the
cathedral three and a half years ago, I
have been able to watch the mischief extending
step by cruel step. At first,
with normal British reluctance to credit
the outrageous or incomprehensible, one
was chiefly concerned to find out
whether, after all, there was not some
sort of military excuse. I severely cross-examined
every one who could be supposed
to know anything about the matter.
There never was any shadow of excuse.</p>

<p>It remained only to record from time
to time the progress of a crime as deliberate
as any in the annals of the war, and
in its own kind particularly damnable&mdash;a
blackhearted crime such as a Comanche
chief or a Congo cannibal would not
have had the wickedness to conceive.</p>

<p>And if there be still any rationalist
obstinate enough to ask for the reason
why of this last outburst of vandalism,
I can only hazard the guess that it may
have been planned, like the long-distance
bombardments of Paris, as a terroristic
accompaniment of the Hindenburg offensive.
It may have been supposed that the
tales of the refugees would help to demoralize
Paris and the rest of the country.
So little after these terrible years
has the boche learned of the people he
set out to conquer.</p>

<p>Well, the Cathedral of St. Louis is not
falling. Wonderful was the work of the
builders. More buttresses, pinnacles, gargoyles,
and stone railings have been
shattered, more statues chipped, and
rain, entering freely by a large rent in
the roof, has worked invisible damage
since my last visit in November. The
cathedral has been struck again. The uplifted
sword of Joan of Arc in the
bronze equestrian statue before the
cathedral has been cut in half.</p>

<p>If this were all, we should have after
the war at least a worthy memorial to
leave to posterity. It is said that it would
now cost a million sterling to restore
the finest Gothic fane in France. I
hope nothing of the kind will be attempted,
nothing more, that is, than the
construction of a new roof, new windows,
doors, and furnishings, and the
necessary strengthening of the structure.</p>

<p>For as it stands, gashed and discolored,
the vast shell has a strange magnificence
and a piteous loveliness like that of some
of the broken splendors that remain to
us from the ancient world. Let Rheims
speak to the future generations as the
ruins of the Acropolis and the Forum
have spoken to our fathers and us.</p>

<p>But the city itself raises a different
and a more difficult problem. It is now
no exaggeration to say that as a whole it
is destroyed beyond hope. Till a fortnight
ago large parts of it were not beyond
the possibility of repair. Remember
that Rheims was not a small town
like Ypres or Arras, but a wealthy and
dignified community of 120,000 souls, occupying
a space equal to one-fifth of
that of Paris.</p>

<p>There is now from end to end probably
not a single house whose walls are not
more or less broken. The northern and
eastern quarters were already in ruins.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_486" title="pg 486"> </a>
Now the centre of the city is gutted. Of
the public buildings the central squares
built in the time or after the Counts of
Champagne, the cloth warehouses and
workshops, the private residences,
bazaars and shops, nothing stands but
rows of smoking walls, half buried in
fallen rafters and masonry.</p>

<h2>The Abomination of Desolation</h2>

<h3>An Episode in France</h3>

<p class="small"><i>Dr. Norman Maclean, an eminent Scottish scholar, whose articles from the
front have appeared in The Scotsman of Edinburgh, penned this touching picture of
the war-devastated Somme region a few days before the Germans again swept over
it in March, 1918:</i></p>

<p class="drop">They stood side by side on a heap of
rubbish inside the door of the ruined
church in the midst of the ruined
town&mdash;a man and woman garbed in humble,
rusty black. The survivors of the
erstwhile population were being brought
back as shelters were prepared and work
provided for them; these had obviously
just returned, and had come straight to
the church. When they fled before the
flood of death, the church stood scatheless,
built immovably upon the rock of
the centuries. It was a shrine of beauty
and a haunt of peace. But as they now
stood on the mound of fallen masonwork
inside the west door, what they saw was
this&mdash;the roof lying in an undulating
ridge piled on the floor, the sacred pictures
torn and tattered; the pillars shattered;
the altar buried under a great
mass of d&eacute;bris, and a figure of the
Christ, uninjured, looking out through
the broken arches on the dead town, and
on the land beyond, where the white
crosses gleam o'er the multitudinous dead.</p>

<p>The man stood motionless, with a face
like a mask. But in a moment the woman
shook as if stricken by an ague. She
turned and stumbled toward the doorway,
where there is no door, the tears coursing
down her cheeks and a sob in her throat.
The man turned and followed her. He
took her hand in his, and they walked
away with bowed heads in silence. It is
strange how the human heart is moved.
It was the tremulous face of that black-robed
woman, and the lifting of her
hands as if to hide the abomination of
desolation from her sight, and the stumbling
flight from a scene intolerable,
that made me feel the horror spread before
me. For I saw it with her eyes.</p>

<p>What she saw was infinitely more than
what I could see. She had experienced
in her own soul that this was holy
ground. In happy days of childhood
heaven seemed to lie here; she had come
hither to be received, in white, into the
holy fellowship; hither to be married;
hither to dedicate her children at the
sacred font. And when the burden of
life was heavier than could be borne, how
often had she come hither; and as she
fell on her knees at the elevation of the
Host, the very God seemed to fold her
in the Eternal Embrace, and her troubles
fled as morning mists before the sun.</p>

<p>And when the war came, and the men
went forth, and with them her sons, how
often did she come softly to this sanctuary
and dip her hand in the holy water
at the door and cross herself, and bow
toward the altar, and kneel and pray that
they might be saved. In and out all day
they came then, men and women, and
they prayed for their own, and for
France, and their prayers were as the
moaning of the winds. * * * And
now this! Nothing is left. Home and
town and children and sanctuary are all
overwhelmed in the one flood. And the
Christ from the broken pillar gazes upon
a perishing world. It is with her as with
those of old, who fell under the heel of
the oppressor and who cried: "Zion is a
wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation; our
holy and our beautiful house where our
fathers praised Thee is burned with fire,
and all our pleasant things are laid
waste."
<a class="pagenum" id="page_487" title="pg 487"> </a></p>

<p>There is that in man which enables
him to meet every blow of fate with unblanched
face&mdash;save one. When the blow
is aimed at his soul, then he shrivels. It
was in her soul that this woman was
smitten, as she saw the house of her God
thus. And that is why there in the land
of death the churches and cathedrals are
all in ruins. To make the altars of Arras
gaze on the clouds and the stars, and
make the winds wail through the colonnades
of Rheims, was deemed the surest
and swiftest way of spreading terror and
affright. So the devot&eacute;es of Odin declared
war upon God. For a little while
the tribal deity and the belligerent dynast
reign supreme. The homeless and bereft,
the great multitude who are as those
standing on the rubble-heap, are verily
left with nothing but their eyes to weep
with.</p>

<p>It is amazing how soon one gets assimilated
to the most horrifying environment.
In a few days one can walk
through a town which has been turned
into heaps without even a shock of wonder,
just as at home one reads the war
news and the list of the dead without any
realization. In these days we need to
be stung broad awake now and then. A
city in ruins becomes deadly monotonous&mdash;until
one is wakened.</p>

<p>One day, when the sun broke forth heralding
the Spring, the promise of green
on a clump of tangled rose bushes tempted
me to turn into the garden of a shattered
villa. It was as thousands of others:
the hearthstones looked upward to
the clouds, and the household goods lay
piled tier on tier of rotting lumber as
floor fell on floor. In the centre of the
green a shell hole took my eye, and I
picked my way toward it. Out of the
earth at the bottom of the hole there obtruded
the bones of a man's arm. In
haste, the dead had been thrown into the
shell hole and lightly covered. And the
rains had washed so much of the earth
away. And that bone brought the realization
that I stood in the midst of one
vast cemetery.</p>

<p>Everywhere and all around under the
feet are the nameless dead&mdash;men, women,
and little children. These last are
the nightmare of this horror. Formerly
nations recovered from war swiftly; the
cradles filled up the gaps. But here the
children are dead. To the eye of faith
the Star of the East shines still with
splendor over every spot where a babe
lies. But that Star has been extinguished
in this region of doom. The altar is
buried, the hearthstone is in the rain,
and amid the welter of rubbish you can
see the children's cots twisted and rusting
and woeful. A woman breaking into
sobs inside a ruined church door; a body
in a shell hole in a garden, a child's cot
rusting on a rubbish heap&mdash;these open
the eyes and make them see.</p>

<p>These things did not come by the arbitrament
of war. It wasn't shrapnel and
high explosives that wrought the desolation.
From the battlements of the old
citadel one can see the dead town lie
spread, and the houses hit by shells are
few and far between. The houses destroyed
wantonly by the enemy ere they
retreated are easily recognized, for the
walls fell outward by the internal explosions.
Ninety-five per cent. have fallen
outward, and the wall of the church is
likewise. This ancient sanctuary was
wantonly destroyed by the retreating enemy.
What amazes one is the appalling
stupidity of such a crime. If the Germans
destroyed the town, that was their
right, the might of the sword, and their
act could perhaps be justified. But to
destroy the church is to destroy what
even Attila spared, and so outrage the
conscience and instinct of the world.
There is never an excuse to seek when
an outrage is perpetrated by the enemy.
A hospital ship is sunk&mdash;but, of course, it
is carrying munitions! A church is
turned into a ruin, but its towers are used
as observation posts! Poor little towers
in a land of airplanes and captive balloons!
If the churches had been spared,
as they were spared in the world's darkest
ages, humanity would know that the
German soul was still alive. But now the
world knows that it is up against an enemy
that threatens body and soul alike&mdash;an
enemy that not only kills the body, but
destroys the soul! What an amazing
stupidity!&mdash;but it is through such stupidity
that God lays up judgment against
the day of wrath.

<h2>Lloyd George and General Maurice</h2>

<h3>A Speech in Which the Premier Routed His
Enemies and Revealed Some Inside Facts</h3>

<p class="drop">A flurry arose in British Parliamentary
circles early in May which
for a day or so threatened to wreck
the Lloyd George Government, but
which resulted in a new triumph for the
Premier and a humiliating defeat for
those who had intrigued against him. It
was precipitated by Major Gen. Sir Frederick
Barton Maurice, who had been Director
of Military Operations until April,
1918, when he was succeeded by Brig.
Gen. Radcliffe. His removal had been
due to a public utterance in which he had
criticised General Foch for not coming
sooner to the assistance of the British
after the beginning of the German offensive.</p>

<p>On May 7 General Maurice published a
letter in which he definitely asserted that
the Premier had made a misleading statement
to the House of Commons April 9,
when he asserted that the British Army
in France on Jan. 1, 1918, was considerably
stronger than on Jan. 1, 1917; that
he misstated the facts regarding the number
of white divisions in Egypt and Palestine;
also that Bonar Law, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, had made a misstatement
in denying that the extension
of the British front in France had been
ordered by the Versailles War Council.</p>

<p>A resolution was introduced by former
Premier Asquith for the appointment of
a committee to investigate the charges.
The Lloyd George Government accepted
the challenge and announced that they
would regard the passage of the resolution
as a vote of censure and would resign
if it was carried. The debate on the
resolution occurred May 9 and resulted in
an overwhelming victory for the Government,
the vote to uphold the Lloyd
George Ministry being 293 to 106; the
Irish members were not present.</p>

<p>In his address the Premier took up the
charges in detail. Regarding the figures
of the British strength he quoted from a
report from General Maurice's own department,
initialed by his deputy, dated
April 27, 1918, which concluded with
these words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the statement included, it will be
seen that the combatant strength of the
British Army was greater on Jan. 1, 1918,
than on Jan. 1, 1917.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also showed that his statements regarding
the relative strength of the opposing
forces in France and the number
of white divisions in Egypt were based
on figures furnished by General Maurice's
department.</p>

<p>Regarding the extension of the British
front in France the Premier made some
interesting disclosures showing that the
extension was made by agreement of
Field Marshal Haig and General P&eacute;tain,
and not by the Versailles Council. He
said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before the council had met it had been
agreed between Field Marshal Haig and
General P&eacute;tain, and the extension was
an accomplished fact. Field Marshal Haig
reported to the council that the extension
had taken place. There was not a single
yard taken over as a result of the Versailles
conference&mdash;not a single yard of
extension.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In discussing this phase Lloyd George
proceeded as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Extending the British Line</h3>

<p>Of course, the Field Marshal was not
anxious to extend his line. No one would
be, having regard to the great accumulation
of strength against him, and the
War Cabinet were just as reluctant.</p>

<p>There was not a single meeting between
the French Generals and ourselves when
we did not state facts against the extension,
but the pressure from the French
Government and French Army was enormous,
and what was done was not done in
response to pressure from the War Cabinet.
It was done in response to very
great pressure which Sir Douglas Haig
could not resist and which we could not
resist. We are not suggesting that our
French allies are asking unfairly. That
is certainly not my intention.</p>

<p>There was a considerable ferment in
France on the subject of the length of the
line held by the French Army as compared
<a class="pagenum" id="page_489" title="pg 489"> </a>
with our army. The French losses
had been enormous. They had practically
borne the brunt of the fighting for three
years. There was a larger proportion of
their young manhood put into the line
than in any belligerent country in the
world. They held 336 miles. We held a
front of 100 miles.</p>

<p>That is not the whole statement, because
the Germans were much more densely
massed in front of ourselves. Not only
that, but the line we held was much more
vulnerable. Practically the defense of
Paris was left to us, and the defense of
some of the most important centres, but
there was the fact that you had this enormous
front held by the French Army, as
compared with what looked like the comparatively
small front of ours.</p>

<h3>Shortage of Farm Labor</h3>

<p>In addition to that, the French Army at
that time was holding, I think, a two-division
front on our line in order to
enable us to accumulate the necessary reserves
for the purposes of the attack in
Flanders. That was part of the line
which, I believe, was held before by the
British and French.</p>

<p>The French were pressing in order to
withdraw men from the army for purposes
of agriculture. I ought to explain
that their agricultural output had fallen
enormously, owing to the fact that they
had withdrawn a very large proportion of
their men from the cultivation of the
fields, and they felt it essential that they
should withdraw part of their army for
the purpose of cultivating the soil, and
they were pressing us upon these topics.</p>

<p>The Chief of the Imperial General Staff,
Sir William Robertson, and the Cabinet
felt that it was inevitable that during
the Winter months there should be some
extension, and we acknowledged that
something had to be done to meet the
French demands, and to that extent we
accepted the principle that there must
be some extension of the line.</p>

<p>At that time the Field Marshal was
under the impression that the Cabinet had
taken a decision without his consent.
The Chief of the Imperial Staff upon
that sent the following memorandum to
the War Cabinet. I will read it, but first,
with reference to the Boulogne Conference,
I may, perhaps, say that that was
the first time we had a discussion with
the French Ministers. The subject of
discussion was a rather important foreign
office. It was not summoned in the least
to discuss an extension of the lines. We
never knew that was to be raised. Sir
William Robertson and I represented the
British Government, and M. Painlev&eacute;, the
Prime Minister, and General Foch represented
the French Government.</p>

<p>When Sir William Robertson discovered
that the Field Marshal was under the
impression that we had come to a decision
without his consent he sent the
War Cabinet a memorandum, in which he
says:</p>

<p>"At the recent Boulogne Conference
the question of extending our front was
raised by the French representatives.
The reply given was that, while in
principle we were, of course, ready to
do whatever could be done, the matter
was one which could not be discussed
in the absence of Sir Douglas Haig,
or during the continuance of the present
operations, and that due regard
must also be had to the plan of operations
for next year.</p>

<p>"It was suggested that it would be
best for the Field Marshal to come to
an arrangement with General P&eacute;tain,
when this could be done. So far as I am
aware no formal discussion has taken
place, and the matter cannot be regarded
as decided. Further, I feel
sure that the War Cabinet would not
think of deciding such a question without
first obtaining Sir Douglas Haig's
views. I am replying to him in the
above sense."</p>

<p>That, I think, was on the 19th of October.
The War Cabinet fully approved of
the communication. Sir Douglas Haig
communicated, and said that it threw a
new light on the Boulogne position. I
think that we have a right to complain of
the way in which it has been rumored
about that Sir Douglas Haig protested.</p>

<h3>The War Cabinet's Decision</h3>

<p>The fact that Sir William Robertson
had explained and Sir Douglas Haig had
stated that the explanation threw new
light has never been repeated. That is
how mischief is done.</p>

<p>On Oct. 24 this question was first formally
discussed by the War Cabinet.
There was further pressure from the
French Government, and Sir William Robertson
gave his views as to the time which
the British Government ought to take,
and this conclusion is recorded in the minutes
of the War Cabinet as follows:</p>

<p>"The War Cabinet approve of the suggestion
of the Chief of the Imperial
Staff that he should reply to Field Marshal
Sir Douglas Haig in the following
sense: The War Cabinet are of the opinion
that in deciding to what extent the
British troops can take over the line
from the French regard must be had to
the necessity of giving them a reasonable
opportunity for leave, rest, and
training during the Winter months and
to the plan of operations for the next
year, and, further, while the present
offensive continues it will not be possible
to commence taking over more
line.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_490" title="pg 490"> </a></p>

<p>"Under these circumstances the War
Cabinet fear that until this policy is
settled it will be premature to decide
finally whether the British front is to
be extended by four divisions or to
greater or lesser extent."</p>

<p>The resolution was communicated to Sir
Douglas Haig by Sir William Robertson,
and we never departed from it. After
that came the Cambrai incident and the
Italian disaster, which necessitated our
sending troops to Italy. That made it
difficult for the Field Marshal to carry
out the promise he made to General P&eacute;tain
for a certain extension of the front. Then
the present French Prime Minister came
in, and he is not a very easy gentleman to
refuse. He was very insistent that the
British Army should take over the line.</p>

<h3>Clemenceau Suggested Versailles</h3>

<p>We stood by the position that that was
a matter to be discussed by the two Commanders
in Chief. We never swerved
from that position. At last M. Clemenceau
suggested that the question should
be discussed by the military representatives
at Versailles, and that the Versailles
Council should decide if there was any
difference of opinion. The military representatives
discussed the question, and
the only interference of the War Cabinet
was to this extent. We communicated
with the Chief of Staff, who was then in
France, and with Sir Douglas Haig to
urge on them the importance of preparing
their case for the other side so as to make
the strongest possible case for the British
view.</p>

<p>The military representatives at Versailles
suggested a compromise, but
coupled with it recommendations as to
steps which ought to be taken by the
French Army to assist the British if they
were attacked, and by the British to
assist the French if they were attacked,
which was even a more important question
than the extension of the front.</p>

<p>That recommendation came up for discussion
at the Versailles Council of Feb.
1. Before that meeting Sir Douglas Haig
and General P&eacute;tain met and entered into
an agreement as to the extension of the
front to Brissy, and Sir Douglas Haig reported
that to the Versailles Council.
When the discussion took place there no
further extension of the line was taken
at all as a result of the discussion.</p>

<p>That is the whole story. I was to make
it perfectly clear that in the action Sir
Douglas Haig took for the extension of the
line he had the full approval of the British
Cabinet, having regard to the pressure
of the French Government and military
authorities. Sir Douglas Haig had no
option except to make the extension. He
was in our judgment absolutely right in
the course he took. Naturally, he would
have preferred not to have done it, but
the British Government fully approved of
the action he took.</p>

<p>The real lesson of the discussion is the
importance of unity of command. It
would never have arisen if you had had
that. Instead of one army and one commander
responsible for one part of the
line, and another army and another commander
responsible for another part of
the line, we have one united command responsible
for the whole and every part.
It was the only method of safety, and I
am glad we have it at last.</p>

<p>It was not so much a question of the
length of the line held by one force or the
length held by another. It was a question
of reserves massed behind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Premier ended with a plea for a
truce to political "sniping." On May 13
it was announced that as a disciplinary
measure General Maurice had been placed
on "the retired list."</p>

<h2>The New British Service Act</h2>

<h3>Provisions of Law Which Raises Military Age</h3>

<p class="drop">The new British Military Service
act became effective in April,
1918, having passed both houses of
Parliament by large majorities; it
immediately received the royal assent.
The provision applying conscription to
Ireland was suspended temporarily, on
the assumption that it would not be enforced
until a measure of home rule for
Ireland was agreed upon. The main provisions
of the new service measure are
as follows, as analyzed by The London
Times:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>RAISING OF MILITARY AGE</h3>

<p>Men Up to 50.&mdash;Obligation to military
service imposed upon every male British
subject:</p>

<p>1. Who has at any time since Aug. 14,
1915, or who for the time being is in Great
Britain, and</p>

<p>2. Who on April 18, 1918, had attained
the age of 18 years and had not attained
the age of 51 years or who at any subsequent
date attains the age of 18 years.</p>

<p>Men Up to 55.&mdash;If it appears necessary
at any time for the defense of the realm,
his Majesty may, by Order in Council, declare
the extension of the obligation to
military service to men generally or to
any class of men up to any age not exceeding
56 years. The draft of any such
order is to be presented to each house of
Parliament, and will not be submitted to
his Majesty in Council unless each house
presents an address, praying that the order
may be made.</p>

<p>Doctors.&mdash;Duly qualified medical practitioners,
who have not attained the age
of 56 years, are made immediately liable
to military service.</p>

<h3>FORMER PRISONERS OF WAR</h3>

<p>The clause in the act of May, 1916, excepting
from military service any person
who has been "a prisoner of war, captured
or interned by the enemy, and has
been released or exchanged," is to cease to
have effect. It is, however, provided that
the change shall be without prejudice to
any undertaking, recognized by the Government,
and for the time being in force,
that any released or exchanged prisoner
of war shall not serve in his Majesty's
forces during the present war.</p>

<h3>TIME-EXPIRED MEN</h3>

<p>The act of May, 1916, provided that the
service should not be prolonged of men
who, when their times for discharge occurred,
had served a period of twelve
years or more and had attained the age
of 41 years. This section is to cease to
have effect.</p>

<h3>EXTENSION TO IRELAND</h3>

<p>Method of Procedure.&mdash;His Majesty may,
by Order in Council, extend the act to
Ireland, with the necessary modifications
and adaptations.</p>

<p>Legal Proceedings.&mdash;An Order in Council
may be issued to make special provision
for the constitution of the civil court before
which proceedings for any offenses
punishable on summary conviction under
the Reserve Forces act, the Army act,
and the Military Service acts are to be
brought in Ireland. The order may also
assign any such proceedings to a specified
civil court or courts.</p>

<h3>WITHDRAWAL OF EXEMPTIONS</h3>

<p>His Majesty may, by proclamation declaring
that a national emergency has
arisen, direct that any certificates of exemption
other than those granted on the
grounds of ill-health or of conscientious
objection shall cease to have effect.</p>

<h3>THE TRIBUNALS</h3>

<p>The Local Government Board or the
Secretary for Scotland may make regulations
for the following purposes:</p>

<p>1. For providing for applications for
certificates of exemption, including appeals,
being made to such tribunals, constituted
in such manner and for such
areas as may be authorized.</p>

<p>2. For establishing special tribunals,
committees, or panels for dealing with
particular classes of cases.</p>

<p>3. For regulating and limiting the making
of applications.</p>

<p>4. For making other provision to secure
the expeditious making and disposal of applications.</p>

<p>It is provided that such regulations shall
not alter the four grounds for applications
for certificates of exemption&mdash;the expediency,
in the national interests, that a man
should be engaged in other work, business
or domestic reasons, ill-health, and conscientious

<h2>British Aid to Italy</h2>

<h3>General Plumer's Dispatch</h3>

<p class="drop">The report was published May 10,
1918, that 250,000 Italian troops
had been concentrated in France to
swell the reserves of the allied
armies against the German offensive, and
that this had been accomplished without
weakening the Italian front, which was
preparing for a threatened Austrian attack.
No statement was made regarding
the British troops that had gone to
Italy's aid during the disaster to the
Italian armies in 1917.</p>

<p>General Sir Herbert Plumer, who took
over the command of the British troops
in Italy after their arrival there, Nov.
10, 1917, submitted his official report
March 9, 1918. He stated that he found
on his arrival that the situation in Italy
was disquieting, the Italian Army having
received a severe blow, and the aid that
the British and French might give could
not be immediate owing to difficulties of
transport. As it was then uncertain
whether the Italians could hold the Piave
line, it was arranged that two British
divisions in conjunction with the French
should move to the hills north and south
of Vicenza. By the time the troops had
reached this position the situation had
improved and an offer was made by the
British in conjunction with the French to
take over a sector of the foothills of the
Asiago Plateau. But as snow was imminent
and special mountain equipment was
difficult to provide, the suggestion was
made by the Italians that the British
should take over the Montsello sector,
with the French on their left. This was
agreed to.</p>

<p>Sir Herbert considers that the entrance
of the French and British had an excellent
moral effect and enabled the Italians
to withdraw and reorganize. The
Montsello sector, which was taken over
on Dec. 4 and work immediately begun
on its defense, is described by Sir Herbert
as a hinge to the whole Italian line, joining
the mountain portion facing north,
from Mount Tomba to Lake Garda, to the
Piave line held by the 3d Italian Army.</p>

<p>December was an anxious month. Several
German divisions were east of the
Piave, and an attempt to force the river
and capture Venice was considered likely.
Local attacks grew more and more
severe, and, though the progress of the
enemy was not great and Italian counterattacks
were constantly made, the danger
of a break-through increased. The Austrians
were being encouraged to persevere
<a class="pagenum" id="page_493" title="pg 493"> </a>
in the hope of getting down to the
plains for the Winter.</p>

<p>Rear lines of defense were constructed,
and as time passed and the preparations
were well forward the feeling of
security grew, and was further increased
by the recapture by the Italians of the
slopes of Monte Asolone on Dec. 22. The
following day Mount Melago and Col del
Rosso, on the Asiago Plateau, were lost,
but the Italians regained the former by
a counterattack. Though Christmas Day
found the situation still serious, especially
on the Asiago, where the Italians,
while fighting stubbornly, suffered from
strain and cold, the situation showed
signs of improvement. This outlook was
brightened still further by the capture
of Mount Tomba, with 1,500 prisoners,
by the French. In this action British
artillery assisted.</p>

<p>"During all this period," the dispatch
continues, "we had carried out continuous
patrol work across the River Piave
and much successful counterbattery
work. The Piave is a very serious obstacle,
especially at this season of the
year, the breadth opposite the British
front being considerably over 1,000
yards, and the current 14 knots. Every
form of raft and boat has been used,
but wading has proved the most successful,
though the icy cold water made the
difficulties even greater. In spite of this
there has never been any lack of volunteers
for these enterprises.</p>

<p>"On Jan. 1 our biggest raid was carried
out by the Middlesex Regiment.
This was a most difficult and well-planned
operation, which had for its
objective the capture and surrounding of
several buildings held by the enemy to a
depth of 2,000 yards inland, provided a
surprise could be effected. Two hundred
and fifty men were passed across by
wading and some prisoners were captured,
but, unfortunately, the alarm was
given by a party of fifty of the enemy
that was encountered in an advanced
post, and the progress inland had therefore,
in accordance with orders, to be
curtailed. The recrossing of the river
was successfully effected, and our casualties
were very few. An operation of
this nature requires much forethought
and arrangement, even to wrapping
every man in hot blankets immediately
on emerging from the icy water.</p>

<p>"The 3d Italian Army also opened
the year well by clearing the Austrians
from the west bank of the Piave about
Zenson. This was followed on Jan. 14
by the attack of the 4th Italian Army
on Mount Asolone, which, although
not entirely successful, resulted in capturing
over 400 Austrian prisoners. The
situation had by this time so far improved
that I offered to take over another
sector of defense on my right in
order to assist the Italians. This was
agreed to, and was completed by Jan. 28.
On this day and the following the 1st
Italian Army carried out successful operations
on the Col del Rosso&mdash;Mont Val Bella
front, on the Asiago Plateau. The infantry
attacked with great spirit, and captured
2,500 Austrians. British artillery
took part in the above operation."</p>

<p>General Plumer states that in February
the weather was bad, much snow
having fallen, and operations were hampered.
Although the British had not
taken part in serious fighting, yet they
had some share in the improvement
which, he says, had taken place.</p>

<p>The work of the R. F. C. under Brig.
Gen. Webb-Bowen, during the period under
review (says Sir Herbert) has been
quite brilliant. From the moment of arrival
they made their presence felt, and
very soon overcame the difficulties of the
mountains. They have taken part in all
operations, and rendered much assistance
to the Italians in the air. They have carried
out a large number of successful
raids on enemy aerodromes, railway junctions,
&amp;c., and have during the period
destroyed sixty-four hostile machines, a
large proportion of which were German,
and nine balloons, our losses to the enemy
during the period being twelve machines
and three balloons.</p>

<p>A comparison of the photographs of
hostile battery positions when our artillery
entered the line with the positions
now occupied shows that the enemy
batteries have been successfully forced
back almost throughout the whole front.
Some British artillery assisted both in
French and Italian operations, and a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_494" title="pg 494"> </a>
frequent interchange of British and Italian
batteries was made, together with
counterbattery staff officers, in order
that experience of each other's methods
might be gained. Every effort was made
to illustrate the value of counterbattery
work, the value of which we had learned
by experience in France, but which the
Italians had not hitherto fully appreciated.</p>

<p>"The Italians were only too anxious to
profit by any experience we could give
them, and this was done not only by frequent
interchange of visits of commanders
and staffs to the various sectors of
defense, but by the establishment of
schools of instruction, at which a large
number of Italian officers actually underwent
the courses. About 100 Italian
officers attended the courses at the various
schools, together with some French
officers. Similarly, British officers underwent
courses at French and Italian
schools."</p>

<p>Sir Herbert thanks the Italian authorities
for their assistance, especially
General Diaz, Chief of the Staff, and expresses
indebtedness to Generals Fayolle
and Maistre, in command of the French
troops.</p>

<h2>Emperor Charles's "Dear Sixtus" Letter</h2>

<h3>French Supplemental Statement Corroborates Its Authenticity</h3>

<p class="drop">The publication of the letter of Emperor
Charles of Austria to his
brother-in-law, Prince Sixtus, in
which he sought a separate peace
with France, referring to the "just
claims" of France to Alsace-Lorraine,
and which caused the downfall of Count
Czernin, the Austrian Foreign Secretary,
was followed by this official denial by
the Austrian Government:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The letter by his Apostolic Majesty,
published by the French Premier in his
communiqu&eacute; of April 12, 1918, is falsified,
(verfaelscht.) First of all, it may be declared
that the personality of far higher
rank than the Foreign Minister, who, as
admitted in the official statement of April
7, undertook peace efforts in the Spring
of 1917, must be understood to be not his
Apostolic Majesty but Prince Sixte of
Bourbon, who in the Spring of 1917 was
occupied with bringing about a rapprochement
between the belligerent States. As
regards the text of the letter published by
M. Clemenceau, the Foreign Minister declares
by All Highest command that his
Apostolic Majesty wrote a purely personal
private letter in the Spring of 1917 to his
brother-in-law, Prince Sixte of Bourbon,
which contained no instructions to the
Prince to initiate mediation with the
President of the French Republic or any
one else, to hand on communications which
might be made to him, or to evoke and
receive replies. This letter, moreover, made
no mention of the Belgian question, and
contained, relative to Alsace-Lorraine, the
following-passage: "I would have used all
my personal influence in favor of the
French claims for the return of Alsace-Lorraine,
if these claims were just. They
are not, however." The second letter of
the Emperor mentioned in the French
Premier's communique of April 9, in
which his Apostolic Majesty is said to
have declared that he was "in accord
with his Minister," is significantly not
mentioned by the French communiqu&eacute;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement drew forth from the
French Government the following reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are rotten consciences. The Emperor
Charles, finding it impossible to
save his face, falls into the stammerings
of a man confounded. He is now reduced
to accusing his brother-in-law of forgery,
by fabricating with his own hand a lying text.
The original document, the text of
which has been published by the French
Government, was communicated in the
presence of M. Jules Cambon, Secretary
General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs,
and delegated for this purpose by
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the
President of the Republic, who, with the
authorization of the Prince, handed a
copy of it to the President of the Council.</p>

<p>The Prince spoke of the matter to M.
Ribot himself in terms which would have
been devoid of sense if the text had not
been that published by the French Government,
is it not evidence that no conversation
could have been opened, and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_495" title="pg 495"> </a>
that the President of the Republic would
not even have received the Prince a second
time, if the latter, at Austria's instance,
had been the bearer of a document
which contested our rights instead
of affirming them?</p>

<p>The Emperor Charles's letter, as we
have quoted it, was shown by Prince
Sixte himself to the Chief of State. Moreover,
two friends of the Prince can attest
the authenticity of the letter, especially
the one who received it from the Prince
to copy it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Serbian Government, moreover,
gave the lie direct to Count Czernin's
statement in reference to offering peace
to Serbia. Premier Pashitch was asked in
the Skupshtina at Corfu by Deputy
Marco Trifcovitch whether Count Czernin's
statement was true. He replied
that he had denied Count Czernin's statements
as soon as he had received the
text of the speech from Amsterdam, and
that he welcomed this fresh opportunity
of declaring before Parliament that, so
far as Serbia was concerned, the statements
were totally inaccurate. (Exclamations
from the right, "Czernin lied!")
The Premier then proceeded to say that
Count Czernin had never made peace
overtures to Serbia, and that, if he had,
such proposals would not have been accepted.
"All the statements of Count
Czernin," continued M. Pashitch, "are
only the result of Austro-Hungarian intrigues."</p>

<p>Premier Clemenceau explained in detail
before three committees of the
French Chamber, the Committees on Foreign
Affairs, the Army, and the Navy,
which represented practically one-fourth
of the total membership, the circumstances
connected with the letters; it was
unanimously agreed that there was nothing
in the situation to justify any further
consideration than had been given
them. The Paris Temps gave the following
details concerning their receipt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Emperor's two letters, and the conversations
arising out of them, will form
an essential part of the proceedings before
the committees today. The letter
from the Emperor to Prince Sixte of
Bourbon-Parma was communicated to M.
Poincar&eacute; on March 31 last year, but it
remained in the possession of the Prince,
who gave a copy of it to M. Ribot, by
whom it was placed in the archives of
the French Foreign Office. "Let us add,"
says the Temps, "that in the course of
the interview which he had with Lloyd
George at Folkestone a few days after
the copy of the letter came into his
possession that M. Ribot handed a copy
of this copy to the British Premier. A
little later in the interview which took
place at St. Jean de Maurienne, in Savoy,
between the chiefs of the British, French,
and Italian Cabinets the question was
raised as to what should be done in case
the Austro-Hungarian Cabinet took steps
toward peace negotiations. An agreement
was come to without difficulty between
the Allies as to the line of conduct to be
adopted in such an eventuality. Let us
add that this first letter sent to Prince
Sixte had determined the Allies to ask for
further explanations, as the result of
which Prince Sixte received from his imperial
brother-in-law a second letter,
which was also communicated to M. Poincar&eacute;
and M. Ribot. We have no right to
give any indication on this subject, but
we believe we can state that this second
letter was regarded unanimously by the
Allies as of such a nature that it would
not permit them to pursue the conversations
further."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kaiser Wilhelm in the following telegram
accepted without reserve Emperor
Charles's statement that the Sixtus letter
had been distorted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Accept my heartiest thanks for your
telegram, in which you repudiate as entirely
baseless the assertion of the French
Premier regarding your attitude toward
French claims to Alsace-Lorraine, and in
which you once again accentuate the solidarity
of interest existing between us and
our respective empires. I hasten to inform
you that in my eyes there was no
need whatever for any such assurance on
your part, for I was not for a moment
in doubt that you have made our cause
your own, in the same measure as we
stand for the rights of your monarchy.
The heavy but successful battles of these
years have clearly demonstrated this fact
to every one who wants to see. They have
only drawn the bonds close together. Our
enemies, who are unable to do anything
against us in honorable warfare, do not
recoil from the most sordid and the lowest
methods. We must, therefore, put up
with it, but all the more is it our duty
ruthlessly to grapple with and beat the
enemy in all the theatres of war. In true
friendship,       <span style="float: right">WILHELM.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a sequel to the matter it was reported
from Vienna that the mother of
Empress Zita and Prince Sixtus had been
compelled to leave Vienna and live in
retirement at her estates, remote from
the Austrian capital.

<h2>THE ISSUES IN IRELAND</h2>

<h3>Official Report of the Irish Convention&mdash;Full Text
of the Chairman's Summary of the Proceedings</h3>

<p class="drop">The Irish home-rule question, in
consequence of the failure of the
Irish Convention to agree, became
an important war issue in the
Spring of 1918 on account of its effect
upon Great Britain's man-power measures.</p>

<p>Premier Lloyd George, on May 21,
1917, announced the Government's decision
to summon a convention of Irishmen
representing all parties and interests
to endeavor to reach an agreement on
the home-rule question. The Sinn Feiners
refused to send representatives, but
all other factions were represented in the
convention, which met July 25, 1917, at
Dublin and elected Sir Horace Plunkett
Chairman.  The report of its recommendations
was made public April 13,
1918, in three separate documents&mdash;the
proposals for a scheme of Irish self-government,
adopted by vote of 44 to 29 in
a total membership of 90; a protest by
the Ulster Unionist delegates, who dissented
from any agreement, and the report
of 22 Nationalist delegates, who
were unable to agree to the fiscal proposals.
The majority proposals were accepted
by practically all the Nationalists,
all the Southern Unionists, and 5 out of
7 of the Labor representatives.</p>

<p>The summary of the proceedings, presented
by Sir Horace Plunkett, and the
scheme of government as agreed upon
by the majority, are of importance historically
for a comparison with subsequent
measures of home rule, which the
British Government announces it intends
to introduce before putting into force
conscription in Ireland.</p>

<h3>THE CHAIRMAN'S SUMMARY</h3>

<h4>Sir Horace Plunkett's letter reads:</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith
the report of the proceedings of the Irish
Convention. For the immediate object of the
Government the report tells all that needs to
be told:</p>

<p>It shows that in the convention, while it
was not found possible to overcome the objections
of the Ulster Unionists, a majority
of Nationalists, all the Southern Unionists,
and five out of the seven Labor representatives
were agreed that the scheme of Irish
self-government set out in Paragraph 42 of
the report should be immediately passed into
law. A minority of Nationalists propose
a scheme which differs in only one important
particular from that of the majority. The
convention has, therefore, laid a foundation
of Irish agreement unprecedented in history.</p>

<p>I recognize that action in Parliament upon
the result of our deliberations must largely
depend upon public opinion. Without a
knowledge of the circumstances which, at the
termination of our proceedings, compelled us
to adopt an unusual method of presenting the
results of our deliberations, the public might
be misled as to what has actually been
achieved. It is, therefore, necessary to explain
our procedure.</p>

<h3>Adopting the Report</h3>

<p>We had every reason to believe that the
Government contemplated immediate legislation
upon the results of our labors. The work
of an Irish settlement, suspended at the outbreak
of the war, is now felt to admit of no
further postponement. In the dominions and
in the United States, as well as in other allied
countries, the unsettled Irish question is a
disturbing factor both in regard to war effort
and peace aims. Nevertheless, urgent as our
task was, we could not complete it until every
possibility of agreement had been explored.
The moment this point was reached&mdash;and you
will not be surprised that it took us eight
months to reach it&mdash;we decided to issue our
report with the least possible delay. To do
this we had to avoid further controversy and
protracted debate. I was, therefore, on
March 22, instructed to draft a report which
should be a mere narrative of the convention's
proceedings, with a statement, for the
information of the Government, of the conclusions
adopted, whether unanimously or by
majorities.</p>

<p>It was hoped that this report might be
unanimously signed; and it was understood
that any groups or individuals would be free
to append to it such statements as they
deemed necessary to give expression to their
views. The draft report was circulated on
March 30, and discussed and amended on
April 4 and 5. The accuracy of the narrative
was not challenged, though there was considerable
difference of opinion as to the relative
<a class="pagenum" id="page_497" title="pg 497"> </a>
prominence which should be given to
some parts of the proceedings. As time
pressed, it was decided not to have any discussion
upon a majority report, nor upon
any minority reports or other statements
which might be submitted. The draft report
was adopted by a majority, and the Chairman
and Secretary were ordered to sign it
and forward it to the Government. A limit
of twenty-four hours was, by agreement, put
upon the reception of any other reports or
statements, and in the afternoon of April 5
the convention adjourned sine die.</p>

<p>The public is thus provided with no majority
report, in the sense of a reasoned
statement in favor of the conclusions upon
which the majority are agreed, but is left
to gather from the narrative of proceedings
what the contents of such a report would
have been. On the other hand, both the
Ulster Unionists and a minority of the Nationalists
have presented minority reports
covering the whole field of the convention's
inquiry. The result of this procedure is to
minimize the agreement reached, and to emphasize
the disagreement. In these circumstances
I conceive it to be my duty as Chairman
to submit such explanatory observations
as are required to enable the reader of the
report and the accompanying documents to
gain a clear idea of the real effect and significance
of the convention's achievement.</p>

<p>I may assume a knowledge of the broad
facts of the Irish question. It will be agreed
that of recent years the greatest obstacle to
its settlement has been the Ulster difficulty.
There seemed to be two possible issues to our
deliberations. If a scheme of Irish self-government
could be framed to which the
Ulster Unionists would give their adherence,
then the convention might produce a unanimous
report. Failing such a consummation,
we might secure agreement, either complete
or substantial, between the Nationalist, the
Southern Unionist, and the Labor representatives.
Many entertained the hope that the
effect of such a striking and wholly new
development would be to induce Ulster to
reconsider its position.</p>

<h3>Ulster Issue Unsolved</h3>

<p>Perhaps unanimity was too much to expect.
Be this as it may, neither time nor effort was
spared in striving for that goal, and there
were moments when its attainment seemed
possible. There was, however, a portion of
Ulster where a majority claimed that, if Ireland
had the right to separate herself from
the rest of the United Kingdom, they had
the same right to separation from the rest of
Ireland. But the time had gone by when any
other section of the Irish people would accept
the partition of their country, even as a
temporary expedient. Hence, the Ulster
Unionist members in the convention remained
there only in the hope that some
form of home rule would be proposed which
might modify the determination of those they
represented to have neither part nor lot in an
Irish Parliament. The Nationalists strove to
win them by concessions, but they found
themselves unable to accept any of the
schemes discussed, and the only scheme of
Irish government they presented to the convention
was confined to the exclusion of their
entire province.</p>

<p>Long before the hope of complete unanimity
had passed, the majority of the convention
were considering the possibilities of agreement
between the Nationalists and the Southern
Unionists. Lord Midleton was the first
to make a concrete proposal to this end. The
report shows that in November he outlined
to the Grand Committee and in December
brought before the convention what looked
like a workable compromise. It accepted
self-government for Ireland. In return for
special minority representation in the Irish
Parliament, already conceded by the Nationalists,
it offered to that Parliament complete
power over internal legislation and administration,
and, in matters of finance, over direct
taxation and excise. But, although they
agreed that the customs revenue should be
paid in to the Irish Exchequer, the Southern
Unionists insisted upon the permanent reservation
to the Imperial Parliament of the
power to fix the rates of customs duties. By
far the greater part of our time and attention
was occupied by this one question,
whether the imposition of customs duties
should or should not be under the control of
the Irish Parliament. The difficulties of the
Irish Convention may be summed up in two
words&mdash;Ulster and Customs.</p>

<h3>Customs and Excise Problem</h3>

<p>The Ulster difficulty the whole world
knows; but how the customs question came
to be one of vital principle, upon the decision
of which depended the amount of agreement
that could be reached in the convention, needs
to be told. The tendency of recent political
thought among constitutional Nationalists
has been toward a form of government resembling
as closely as possible that of the
dominions, and, since the geographical position
of Ireland imposes obvious restrictions in
respect of naval and military affairs, the
claim for dominion home rule was concentrated
upon a demand for unrestricted fiscal
powers. Without separate customs and excise
Ireland would, according to this view,
fail to attain a national status like that enjoyed
by the dominions.</p>

<p>Upon this issue the Nationalists made a
strong case, and were able to prove that a
considerable number of leading commercial
men had come to favor fiscal autonomy as
part of an Irish settlement. In the present
state of public opinion in Ireland it was
feared that without customs no scheme the
convention recommended would receive a
sufficient measure of popular support to secure
legislation. To obviate any serious
disturbance of the trade of the United Kingdom
the Nationalists were prepared to agree
<a class="pagenum" id="page_498" title="pg 498"> </a>
to a free-trade arrangement between the
two countries. But this did not overcome
the difficulties of the Southern Unionists,
who on this point agreed with the Ulster
Unionists. They were apprehensive that a
separate system of customs control, however
guarded, might impair the authority of the
United Kingdom over its external trade
policy. Neither could they consent to any
settlement which was, in their judgment, incompatible
with Ireland's full participation
in a scheme of United Kingdom federation,
should that come to pass.</p>

<p>It was clear that by means of mutual concessions
agreement between the Nationalists
and the Southern Unionists could be reached
on all other points. On this important point,
however, a section of the Nationalists, who
have embodied their views in a separate report,
held that no compromise was possible.
On the other hand, a majority of the Nationalists
and the whole body of Southern
Unionists felt that nothing effective could
result from their work in the convention unless
some understanding was reached upon
customs which would render an agreement
on a complete scheme attainable. Neither
side was willing to surrender the principle;
but both sides were willing, in order that
a Parliament should be at once established,
to postpone a legislative decision upon the
ultimate control of customs and excise. At
the same time each party has put on record,
in separate notes subjoined to the report, its
claim respecting the final settlement of this
question. A decision having been reached
upon the cardinal issue, the majority of the
convention carried a series of resolutions
which together form a complete scheme of
self-government.</p>

<h3>Parliament for All Ireland</h3>

<p>This scheme provides for the establishment
of a Parliament for the whole of Ireland,
with an Executive responsible to it,
and with full powers over all internal legislation,
administration, and direct taxation.
Pending a decision of the fiscal question, it
is provided that the imposition of duties of
customs and excise shall remain with the
Imperial Parliament, but that the whole of
the proceeds of these taxes shall be paid into
the Irish Exchequer. A joint Exchequer
Board is to be set up to determine the Irish
true revenue, and Ireland is to be represented
upon the Board of Customs and Excise of
the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The principle of representation in the Imperial
Parliament was insisted upon from the
first by the Southern Unionists, and the
Nationalists conceded it. It was felt, however,
that there were strong reasons for providing
that the Irish representatives at Westminster
should be elected by the Irish Parliament
rather than directly by the constituencies,
and this was the arrangement
adopted.</p>

<p>It was accepted in principle that there
should be an Irish contribution to the cost
of imperial services, but owing to lack of
data it was not found possible in the convention
to fix any definite sum.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the Irish Parliament
should consist of two houses&mdash;a Senate of
sixty-four members and a House of Commons
of 200. The principle underlying the
composition of the Senate is the representation
of interests. This is effected by giving
representation to commerce, industry, and
labor, the County Councils, the Churches,
learned institutions, and the peerage. In
constituting the House of Commons the Nationalists
offered to guarantee 40 per cent.
of its membership to the Unionists. It was
agreed that, in the south, adequate representation
for Unionists could only be secured
by nomination; but, as the Ulster representatives
had informed the convention that
those for whom they spoke could not accept
the principle of nomination, provision was
made in the scheme for an extra representation
of Ulster by direct election.</p>

<p>The majority of the Labor representatives
associated themselves with the Nationalists
and Southern Unionists in building up the
Constitution, with the provisions of which
they found themselves in general agreement.
They frankly objected, however, to the principle
of nomination and to what they regarded
as the inadequate representation of Labor in
the upper house. Throughout our proceedings
they helped in every way toward the
attainment of agreement. Nor did they
press their own special claims in such a
manner as to make more difficult the work,
already difficult enough, of agreeing upon a
Constitution.</p>

<h3>Knottiest Question in History</h3>

<p>I trust I have said enough to enable the
reader of this report and the accompanying
documents to form an accurate judgment
upon the nature and difficulties of the task
before the convention and upon its actual
achievement. While, technically, it was our
function to draft a Constitution for our country,
it would be more correct to say that we
had to find a way out of the most complex
and anomalous political situation to be found
in history&mdash;I might almost say in fiction. We
are living under a system of government
which survives only because the act abolishing
it cannot, consistently with Ministerial
pledges, be put into operation without further
legislation no less difficult and controversial
than that which it has to amend. While the
responsibility for a solution to our problem
rests primarily with the Government, the
convention found itself in full accord with
your insistence that the most hopeful path to
a settlement was to be found in Irish agreement.
In seeking this&mdash;in attempting to find
a compromise which Ireland might accept
and Parliament pass into law&mdash;it has been
recognized that the full program of no party
could be adopted. The convention was also
bound to give due weight to your opinion that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_499" title="pg 499"> </a>
to press for a settlement at Westminster,
during the war, of the question which, as I
have shown, had been a formidable obstacle
to agreement would be to imperil the prospect
of the early establishment of self-government
in Ireland.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the difficulties with which
we were surrounded, a larger measure of
agreement has been reached upon the principle
and details of Irish self-government
than has yet been attained. Is it too much
to hope that the scheme embodying this
agreement will forthwith be brought to fruition
by those to whose call the Irish Convention
has now responded? I have the honor
to be, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<h3>ULSTER UNIONISTS' REPORT</h3>

<p>Nineteen Ulster Unionists signed a
dissenting report in which they declared
that it had soon become evident to them
that no real approach to agreement was
possible, as the Nationalists put it beyond
doubt that what they wanted was "full
national independence," or a Parliament
possessing co-equal powers with those of
the Imperial Parliament. If the Ulster
Unionists had anticipated this at the outset,
their report explained, they "could
not have agreed to enter the convention."
Objection was taken to the Nationalist
<a class="pagenum" id="page_502" title="pg 502"> </a>
scheme, which aimed at denying the right
of the Imperial Parliament to impose
military service in Ireland "unless with
the consent of the proposed Irish Parliament."</p>

<p>Dr. Mahaffy, Provost of Trinity College,
Dublin, and the Archbishop of
Armagh, in a separate note, stated that
they found it impossible to vote for the
majority proposals, since these involved,
in their opinion, either the coercion of
Ulster, which was unthinkable, or the
partition of Ireland, which would be disastrous.</p>

<p>Twenty-two Nationalists, including Joseph
Devlin, M. P., the Archbishop of
Cashel, the Bishop of Raphoe, the Bishop
of Down and Connor, and the Lord
Mayors of Dublin and Cork, signed a report
favoring a subordinate Irish Parliament
with immediate full powers of taxation.</p>

<p>The majority of the Nationalists also
signed a note explaining that for the sake
of reaching an agreement with the
Unionists they did not press their claim
for full fiscal autonomy.</p>

<p>The Southern Unionists, who for "high
considerations of allied and imperial interests"
signed the majority report, also
added a note. They insisted that all imperial
questions and services, including
the levying of customs duties, be left in
the hands of the Parliament of the
United Kingdom; that Ireland send representatives
to Westminster; and that
the whole of Ireland participate in any
Irish Parliament.</p>

<h3>THE FINANCIAL ISSUE</h3>

<p>Apart from the main question whether
an Irish Parliament with an Executive
responsible to it should be established,
debate chiefly centred on the question of
fiscal autonomy. By January, 1918, it
became apparent that on the financial
issue there were three clearly defined
bodies of opinion:</p>

<p>First&mdash;The Ulster Unionists favoring
the maintenance of the fiscal unity of the
United Kingdom;</p>

<p>Second&mdash;A section of Nationalists insisting
upon complete fiscal autonomy
for Ireland;</p>

<p>Third&mdash;The Southern Unionists, supported
by other Nationalists, and the
majority of the Labor representatives,
favoring a compromise which left to Ireland
the proceeds of all sources of revenue
and the imposition of all taxes other
than customs.</p>

<p>It was to overcome these and other
differences that Premier Lloyd George
invited representatives of the convention
to London to confer with the Cabinet.
The Premier's letter, dated Feb. 25, 1918,
is published in the report. It discloses
the fact that some of the Nationalists
had been willing to set up an Ulster
Committee in the Irish Parliament to
veto the application of certain legislation
to that province, to make Belfast the
headquarters of the Irish Ministry of
Commerce, and to let the Irish Parliament
meet alternately in Dublin and Belfast.</p>

<h3>GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE</h3>

<p>Dealing with "the difficult question of
customs and excise," Lloyd George wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Government are aware of the serious
objections which can be raised against
the transfer of these services to an Irish
Legislature. It would be practically impossible
to make such a disturbance of
the fiscal and financial relations of Great
Britain and Ireland in the midst of a
great war. It might also be incompatible
with that federal reorganization of the
United Kingdom in favor of which there is
a growing body of opinion. On the other
hand, the Government recognize the strong
claim that can be made that an Irish
Legislature should have some control over
indirect taxation as the only form of
taxation which touches the great majority
of the people, and which in the past has
represented the greater part of Irish revenue.</p>

<p>The Government feel that this is a matter
which cannot be finally settled at the
present time. They therefore suggest for
the consideration of the convention that,
during the period of the war and for a
period of two years thereafter, the control
of customs and excise should be reserved
to the United Kingdom Parliament;
that, as soon as possible after the Irish
Parliament has been established, a Joint
Exchequer Board should be set up to
secure the determination of the true revenue
of Ireland&mdash;a provision which is essential
to a system of responsible Irish
government&mdash;and to the making of a
national balance sheet, and that, at the
end of the war, a royal commission should
be established to re-examine impartially
and thoroughly the financial relations of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_503" title="pg 503"> </a>
Great Britain and Ireland, to report on
the contribution of Ireland to imperial
expenditure, and to submit proposals as
to the best means of adjusting the
economic and fiscal relations of the two
countries.</p>

<p>The Government consider that during the
period of the war the control of all taxation
other than customs and excise could
be handed over to the Irish Parliament;
that for the period of the war and two
years thereafter an agreed proportion of
the annual imperial expenditure should
be fixed as the Irish contribution; and
that all Irish revenue from customs and
excise as determined by the Joint Exchequer
Board, after deduction of the
agreed Irish contribution to imperial expenditure,
should be paid into the Irish
Exchequer. For administrative reasons,
during the period of the war it is necessary
that the police should remain under
imperial control, and it seems to the Government
to be desirable that for the same
period the postal service should be a reserved
service.</p>

<h3>CONSCRIPTION IN IRELAND</h3>

<p>The announcement of the British Government's
twofold plan of home rule
and conscription for Ireland caused an
outpouring of protests from the whole
of the Nationalist population. Preparations
for resistance were begun, a great
anti-conscription fund was opened, resolutions
from public bodies began pouring
in, and the Sinn Fein clubs renewed their
activities.</p>

<p>The most striking feature of the opposition
to conscription was that it welded
together all the Irish elements represented
by the Nationalist Party, the Independent
Home Rulers, led by William
O'Brien and Timothy Healy; the Sinn
Fein, and the Labor organizations, which
in recent years had not been very friendly
to the Nationalists. Representatives of
all these parties were present at a conference
in Dublin, held, under the Chairmanship
of the Lord Mayor, on April 18.
The Catholic Bishops, at a meeting in
Maynooth the same day, adopted a declaration
against conscription. This meeting
was attended by five representatives
from the Dublin conference&mdash;John Dillon,
Edward de Valere, Timothy Healy,
a Labor delegate, and the Lord Mayor
of Dublin.</p>

<p>A majority of the Nationalist members
of the House of Commons decided to
abstain from attendance in Parliament
during the crisis, thus adopting the attitude
of the Sinn Feiners who were elected
to the House but have never attended.
Fifty-five of the Nationalist members
met in Dublin on April 20, with John
Dillon presiding, and passed a resolution
in which they declared that the enforcement
of compulsory military service
on a nation without its assent constituted
"one of the most brutal acts of
tyranny and oppression of which any
Government can be guilty."</p>

<p>Fifteen hundred delegates of labor
unions met at the Mansion House, Dublin,
on April 20, and pledged their resistance
to conscription. They also fixed
April 23 for the stoppage of all work as
an earnest of this resolve and to enable
all workers to sign the pledge of resistance.
The complete stoppage of work
was duly observed on the day mentioned,
and passed off for the most part in a
quiet and orderly manner.</p>

<p>Sunday, April 21, was observed
throughout Catholic Ireland as the day
for the administration by the priests of
the anti-conscription covenant. From
every Catholic pulpit conscription was
the subject of discourse, and the action
of the Bishops and political leaders was
explained. The assemblies where the
pledge was taken were generally outside
the churches, sometimes in the open air,
sometimes in a hall. The practice followed
in many cases was for the priest
to read the pledge, sentence by sentence,
the people reciting after him. In other
cases the pledge was given by the raising
of hands or the signing of a paper. The
Bishops took part with the inferior
clergy in administering the pledge, addressing
the people and generally warning
them against isolated and unconsidered
action. They urged obedience to the
orders of the recognized leaders, who act
in co-operation. All classes, including
lawyers, bankers, and merchants, as well
as farmers and workmen, took the pledge.</p>

<p>On May 1 an Order in Council was
issued by the British Government postponing
the operation of the National
Service, or conscription, act in Ireland beyond
that date, to which it had been
previously postponed.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_504" title="pg 504"> </a></p>

<p>Premier Lloyd George, commenting on
the new attitude of the Irish Home Rulers
in a letter addressed on May 2 to Irish
workers on the Tyneside in England,
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The difficulties have not been rendered
easier of settlement by the challenge to
supremacy of the United Kingdom Parliament
in that sphere, which always has
been regarded as properly belonging to
it by all advocates of home rule, which
recently was issued by the Nationalist
Party and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy
in concert with the leaders of the Sinn
Fein.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Nationalist and Catholic Ireland
had already begun its campaign of resistance
to conscription, the Ulster
Unionists, under the leadership of Sir
Edward Carson, prepared to oppose
home rule. Sir Edward Carson declared
that the Government had broken its
pledges to Ulster by undertaking to pass
a Home Rule bill, and on April 24 he advised
the Ulster Unionist Council to reorganize
its machinery for the impending
struggle.</p>

<p>The appointment of Field Marshal
Viscount French as Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland and of Edward Shortt, member
of the House of Commons for Newcastle-on-Tyne,
as Chief Secretary for Ireland
was officially announced on May 5.</p>

<p>Lord French, before his new appointment,
was Commander in Chief of the
forces in the United Kingdom and had
gone to Ireland in that capacity a few
days before he became Viceroy. Edward
Shortt, in addition to being a Home
Ruler, had voted against the extension
of conscription to Ireland until an Irish
Government had been established.</p>

<h2>Greatest Gas Attack of the War</h2>

<p><i>W. A. Willison, Canadian correspondent, cabled from the Picardy front on
March 22, 1918:</i></p>

<p>While British and German troops were struggling far to the south in the
opening clash of the Spring campaign, the greatest projector gas bombardment
in the world's history was carried out by the Canadians tonight against the
enemy positions between Lens and Hill 70. Sharply at 11 o'clock the signal
rocket gave notice of the beginning. A moment later over 5,000 drums of lethal
gas were simultaneously released from projectors, and were hurled into the
enemy territory from the outskirts of Lens, and northward to Cit&eacute; St. Auguste
and the Bois de Dix-Huit.</p>

<p>From his front lines and strong points favoring winds carried the
poisonous clouds back upon the enemy's supports, reserves, and assembly areas.
The whole of the front was lit up with enemy flares, dimly seen through the
heavy mist, while the men in our lines could hear the enemy's gas alarms and
cries of distress from the hostile trenches.</p>

<p>Nine minutes later our field artillery, supported by heavy guns and heavy
trench mortars, opened up with a slow bombardment, which gradually increased
in intensity, until, forty minutes later, the enemy positions were swept with a
short, intensive, creeping barrage, which raked his forward and rear areas with
high explosive. Caught by our gas without a moment's warning, caught again
as he was emerging from his shelters by our artillery, the enemy's casualties
must have been very heavy, for the effectiveness of our smaller gas operations
has been emphatically proved by the evidence of prisoners.</p>

<p>Tonight's bombardment was three times greater than anything of its kind
ever attempted by us on the Western front, and much greater than anything
ever launched by the Germans, though the score of the second battle of Ypres
and other reckonings are still to be settled, and will be settled.

<h2>Plucky Dunkirk</h2>

<h3>By Anna Milo Upjohn</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Inspector in Paris for the Fraternit&eacute; Americaine</i></p>

<p class="small">[Since this article was written Dunkirk has faced a new peril from the blow struck in
her direction by the powerful German armies around Ypres, to the southeast; but the author's
vivid and sympathetic description of the daily life of the little city remains as true as in
the Winter days when it was penned for <span class="smcap">Current History Magazine</span>.</p>

<p class="drop">In the track of the wind stands the
plucky little City of Dunkirk, still
flapping the flags of courage and
constancy in the face of an increasingly
rabid enemy. It is the only city of
France that is subjected to bombardment
from land and sea and sky.</p>

<p>What is the every-day life in a town
near enough to the front to be never free
from the menace of a triple bombardment?
That is what I went to find out,
traveling by way of Calais in stygian
darkness, for the train was without lights
to avoid the danger of bombs.</p>

<p>A little before dawn the train drew
into the black station of Dunkirk, through
whose roofing the sky showed dimly in
spots where air-raid shells had spattered.
The silent crowd jostled through the
darkness, the soldiers separating themselves
from it at the military exit. Inside,
only a ray from a dark lantern,
held by the officer who scanned the passports
one by one, made a spot of light
among the overlapping shadows. The
wind sighed through the draughty place,
the snow entered freely, the floor was
sloppy with mud. Outside in the empty
square not a vehicle, not a porter, in
sight. The street cars had stopped running.</p>

<p>My hotel lay beyond the centre of the
town. In the driving storm, through unknown
streets, I knew it would be foolish
to attempt to find it. An officer passed
and to him I appealed. "To the right, in
the middle of the square," he said, with
outstretched arm, "is the Lion de
Flandre. If they can't put you up there,
come back and we will see."</p>

<p>Not a point of light indicated the identity
of the Lion de Flandre. On nearer
approach all the houses appeared boarded
up, as though long since abandoned.
In the middle of the square was an oblong
hump, like the roofed-over foundation
of a demolished building. I learned
later that this was a public refuge built
for the inhabitants of the section.</p>

<h3>HOTEL IN DANGER ZONE</h3>

<p>As I turned irresolutely in the direction
of the dark fa&amp;ccedil;ades, the silhouette
of a man in casque and puttees passed
across the snow. A crack of light
gleamed from a hidden doorway, and
through it he disappeared. I followed
hard after him and stepped into a lighted
room full of smoke and soldiers, a <i>man's</i>
place, with sand-strewn floor and bottles
conspicuously in evidence. Nevertheless,
the comfortable woman behind the bar
received me without surprise. A room
she could give me, but as for food, that
was a different matter. The boches
had the habit of coming at about dinner
time, and it had become a nuisance to
abandon the untasted meal every night
and to dive into the cave&mdash;it really had!
So she had given up trying to have anything
hot at night and let the fires go
out at 6. But if I would like a sandwich
and some beer&mdash;?</p>

<p>After the long, starved journey this
was not alluring.</p>

<p>"Not a cup of tea with the sandwich?"
I pleaded. A collaborator was called, a
plump, dark woman, and after a hurried
conference I was asked to wait in the
room behind the caf&eacute;. Nothing could be
more dismal than this compartment. It
was high for its floor space, like a deep
box with a lid, and had no outside windows,
being wedged between the caf&eacute; and
the kitchen. The ornate glass divisions
were gone or clinging in fragments, the
walls pierced in many places, the plaster
down. A tiny point of gas burned high
above the table.</p>

<p>They were very good to me, these warbound
<a class="pagenum" id="page_506" title="pg 506"> </a>
women, one of whom, I discovered,
had an ulcerated tooth, the other two
little boys captive in Belgium.</p>

<h3>FIRST NIGHT'S EXPERIENCES</h3>

<p>In a short time a small bit of steak
and a potato cut in quarters and fried
were placed before me, and simultaneously
a large black dog with wistful eyes
but determined manner stationed himself
at my side. The steak was followed by
a chilly little salad, bread and cheese,
and more butter than I had seen for many
a month in Paris&mdash;and a cup of tea which,
for its grateful warmth, I drank without
challenge.</p>

<p>Snatches of honest English, mingled
with French, filtered in from the caf&eacute;,
where the fire was not quite extinct and
where beer was served until 9 o'clock.
Before that hour I was fumbling upstairs
guided by the patronne, who carried
a two-inch stub of candle between
her fingers. "This is the way to the
cave," she explained, pointing to a doorway
under the stairs. "In case of an
alarm you have only to rush down there.
There will be a light burning at the entrance."
Passing through the hallway
she indicated the spot where a man had
recently been killed. "If he had stayed
where he was, at the table where you
have just eaten, Madame, he would have
been all right, but as he ran to the refuge
a bomb exploded outside in the
square, burst open the front door, traversed
the length of the corridor, passed
through the kitchen wall and into the
garden beyond. But you can rest assured
that nothing will happen tonight,
Madame," continued the patronne, who
seemed as familiar with the habits of
Gothas as a farmer's wife is with those
of fowls&mdash;"Not in this wind, oh, no!"</p>

<p>After that first night I groped my
way alone to bed, the candle stub having
come to an end, feeling my way along
the pitch dark passageways to the room
with the linoleum mat, the room which
had not known fire for three years and
a half, whose paneless windows were
boarded up, the one room in the house
which had not lost a ceiling or floor or
whose walls were not clipped through
with shells. The regular inmates of the
hotel slept nightly in the cellar. It saved
time and was warmer.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the reassurances of
the patronne I confess to going to bed
with half my clothes on. But under the
wing of the storm Dunkirk slept tranquilly
for three successive nights. Of
course, there was always the soft bum-bum
of the cannon on the northern horizon,
strange tremors shook the bed, and
the night was full of weird sounds, the
rattling skeletons of dead houses.</p>

<h3>BRAVE LITTLE DUNKIRK</h3>

<p>Like an arm held up to protect the
face, the coast between Calais and Dunkirk
bears the brunt of storm from the
North Sea. A dark sea, sombre and
brooding, girdled by lowering clouds; on
the snow-driven plain a few detached
towers, etched as though in sepia against
the gray sky and rising abruptly above
the low line of roof&mdash;this is Dunkirk on
a Winter's day. A homely little town
with a deep fringe of docks and waterways
on its seaward side and a girdle
of fortifications built by Vauban encircling
the rest. The whole set in a ring
of dark water which fills the moat. It
is thoroughly Flemish in character, and,
seen from the water, must resemble a
city on a delft tile. The moral attitude
of the town has always been one of robust
activity. Even its patron saints are
among the most industrious and enterprising
in the calendar&mdash;notably St. Eloi,
who brought Christianity to the Dunkerquois
and to whom the original Dunkirk
(church on the dunes) was dedicated.</p>

<p>All the history of the town is tinged
with a vigor which has blown in to it
from the sea. Here the crusading ships
of Baldwin of Flanders, and later those
of St. Louis of France, were fitted out.
After the momentous marriage of Marie
of Burgundy had thrown the city for a
time under the dominion of Spain it
played a brilliant part in the game of
the period&mdash;piracy.</p>

<p>The quaint tower on the quay&mdash;called
Lugenhaer, the Liar&mdash;was used at that
epoch to give false signals to ships at
sea. But it dates from a much earlier
period, and was one of twenty-eight
towers with which Baldwin of Flanders
<a class="pagenum" id="page_507" title="pg 507"> </a>
bound together the wall with which he
surrounded the city. The Liar and the
belfry of the recently ruined Cathedral
of St. Eloi were the only interesting
architectural bits left in Dunkirk. The
thirteenth century tower, dark and strong
at its base, rises to a great height,
flowering into restrained tracery at the
top and shepherding under its shadow
the heart of the town, which lies below
it. This is the lodestone. Toward it I
turned after leaving the battered hotel
that first morning at Dunkirk.</p>

<h3>CITY OF SHATTERED HOMES</h3>

<p>From the snowy Place de la Gare the
street cars started regularly in divergent
directions, but oh, the gloom of those
dead streets which they passed! Wide
streets, winding between rows of low
houses, plain and solid, but built on a
neighborly plan. Their desolation is the
more marked because of this innate,
homelike quality. In almost all of them
the window and door spaces were boarded
up, and the first impression was rather
that of a deserted city than of a demolished
one. But a second glance showed
that destruction had come from the sky,
tearing away the roof, annihilating the
interior, and rendering the house uninhabitable,
perhaps irreparable, though
the walls might to a certain extent be
left standing. Often the havoc was more
apparent, exposing the bare skeleton of
a home and the shattered remnants of
household comforts in shocking nudity.</p>

<p>The freakishness of destruction by
bombardment is proverbial. It is this
which creates in the timid an intense
anxiety and in the hardy the willingness
to take a chance. The 8-year-old son of
the chief surgeon at the Military Hospital,
stretching out his hand during a
bombardment, said calmly, "Of course
it <i>may</i> fall on <i>that</i>, but there is plenty
of room on each side." And this rather
sums up the spirit of the Dunkerquois
who remain.</p>

<p>Of a population of 40,000, about 5,000
are left, and most of these have become
modern cave men. To be thoroughly up
to date one must live in a "casemate."
In every quarter of the town posters announce
the locality of these public refuges.
They are either cellars reinforced
overhead, or dugouts in the public
squares, strongly roofed with corrugated
iron, which is covered with wood and
sandbags. Often there is extra trench
work inside, always a tight little stove
with a pipe running the length of the
cave, plank benches along the sides, and
usually beds with army blankets.</p>

<h3>DODGING THE BOMBS</h3>

<p>Into these refuges the Dunkerquois
has learned to precipitate himself with
extraordinary celerity. He considers a
minute and a half sufficient time in
which to gain safety, no matter where
he may be when the "alerte" is given.
When there is a bombardment from the
land side the alarm is sounded as the
obus[**? *french for shell] leaves the gun at the front. It takes
90 seconds for its flight to Dunkirk. So
accurately is this calculated that casualties
seldom result from a land bombardment.
The inhabitants scuttle into
safety, and the damage is limited to
bricks and mortar. The peppering from
sea is also taken lightly. The firing is
very rapid, but it is soon over, and the
shots are comparatively small, passing
clean through the walls without shattering
them. It is the air raids which are
dreaded, and these are increasingly frequent
and destructive. Often the chugging
of the motors can be heard in the
thick darkness for a quarter of an hour
or more before there is an explosion, and
this is a nerve-racking experience.</p>

<p>A striking feature of the streets in
Dunkirk is the incumbrance of the sidewalks
by boxes filled with stones and
sandbags. These cover the windows and
approaches to the cellars and serve as
shock absorbers against flying pieces of
shell.</p>

<p>And why does any one stay in so precarious
an outpost on the verge of the
fighting line? Some perhaps because
to set forth alone or with a brood of children
into an unknown world already
trampled by countless refugees seems
an equally perilous outlook. Others because
their maintenance still depends
upon the docks and shipyards, though
the 6,000 longshoremen usually employed
about the piers have disappeared. Then
<a class="pagenum" id="page_508" title="pg 508"> </a>
there are those whose interests are bound
up in a shop or other investment in the
town, and business is brisk in Dunkirk,
owing to the presence of two armies.
A few there are who are not only <i>of</i>
Dunkirk but who <i>are</i> Dunkirk itself,
upon whose presence depends the prosperity
of the town and its usefulness to
the State.</p>

<h3>STILL A LIVELY PORT</h3>

<p>For if the picturesque landmarks have
disappeared, Dunkirk has by no means
lost its sea prestige. It is the third port
of France, and though its position is
singularly exposed it is largely through
its harbor that the British Army has
been revictualed since the beginning of
the war. This renders still more remarkable
the fact that not one ship has been
lost between Dunkirk and the English
port of clearing. One does not appreciate
at first glance all that this implies.
It means for one thing that some one must
sit tight at Dunkirk. Traffic by sea has
gone on uninterruptedly and until recently
has been quite that of normal times.
Now, owing to the recent restrictions on
imports and exports, it is greatly reduced,
though still regular. The sailings and
dockings take place on schedule time.</p>

<p>One of those largely responsible for
the order of the port is the Consular
Agent of the United States, M. Morel,
also President of the Chamber of Commerce
of Dunkirk. His house, a mere
skeleton, has long since been abandoned
for the superior comforts and safety of
the cellar. Attached to the jamb of the
almost equally ruined office building his
small sign in black and gold makes a
brave showing. The front of the building
had been largely torn away and with
it a part of the roof. Looking up one
saw a dizzy arrangement of laths and
rafters, suggestive of the underside of
a heap of jackstraws. But the staircase
was firm and led to a small back room,
where a bright fire burned and where
business was transacted as usual; not
only the business of the port, for while
I was there an American Red Cross doctor
and a bevy of nurses came in to have
their passports renewed.</p>

<p>Another home which I had the privilege
of entering, that of Commandant
Boultheel, had been more fortunate, for
it stood as yet untouched by disaster.
Here in an atmosphere of warm charm,
a serene and gracious hostess dispensed
hospitality to her friends. Pewter and
old china on the walls and a great fire
of logs dispelled the depression of the
outside world. Around the table were
men of war and men of the world, who
represented the finest qualities of the
French. Among them was a valiant
Pr&eacute;fet du Nord, who had spent ten
months as hostage in a German prison,
using his time to study English and reread
Horace. In fact, I felt, as I had on
the train, that the further I got from
Paris the nearer I came to the heart of
France.</p>

<p>A glimpse of "cave life" I had in the
pharmacie maintained by the Sisters of
the Sacr&eacute; Coeur in the basement of the
H&ocirc;tel de Ville, where it had been temporarily
installed by the city, its own quarters
being untenable. This was a large
space lighted by electricity and crowded
with bottles and jars, bundles of herbs
and bandages, and made cheerful by the
bright faces of the sisters. In another
portion of the cellar they sleep, living entirely
underground.</p>

<p>Families are large in Dunkirk, and
children troop unconcernedly to and fro
between home and school. To them the
nightly flight to the casemate is no longer
a wild adventure.</p>

<h3>BUSINESS UNDER DIFFICULTIES</h3>

<p>The business part of the town has not
the sad aspect of the residence streets,
for it is full of life. The decrepit shops,
half boarded up, many of them resembling
a face with a bandage over one eye,
are doing a lively business. With the
demands of a large floating population
of two armies, Dunkirk is not suffering
commercially. Department stores, book
shops, shoe stores, provision shops of all
kinds, make the most of a short day.
Oranges, figs, dates, nuts, and conserved
food of all kinds are much in evidence,
also warm clothing, blankets, boots, and
novels. The restaurant of the H&ocirc;tel Chapeau
Rouge was filled with French and
English officers, and an excellent meal
<a class="pagenum" id="page_509" title="pg 509"> </a>
was served much as it would be in Paris.
At 4:30 everything is closed. Lights are
extinguished, windows and doors are
sealed with their householders behind
them, unless the latter are among those
who seek the comparative safety of the
suburbs at nightfall. For though the
entire surrounding country is subject to
bombardment, the town is the centre of
attack. In the twilight of the unlighted
streets scarce a footfall is heard. Only
the occasional rumble of a heavy cannon
shakes the air. Behind the wall of darkness
pulses a full life undismayed by the
terrors of the approaching night or the
possibilities of the tomorrow.</p>

<h3>A STAG AT BAY</h3>

<p>In the heart of the forest I once saw a
stag leading his herd to the shelter of a
rock in the rush of an oncoming storm.
Having urged them into crouching positions
around him, he turned and with a
simple gesture lifted his head to the
storm. There was that in his attitude
which compelled reverence. One mentally
saluted, though one might think "poor,
silly beast, in what way could he mitigate
the lash of the tempest?" But instinctively
he had obeyed the highest
for which he had been created, the protection
of the weak. And his calm
presence caught away all panic from
those around him. Often while in Dunkirk
this scene came back to me, recalled
by the simple matter-of-courseness with
which these brave men and equally brave
women stayed on because it was the place
for them to be.</p>

<p>At the Military Hospital of Rosendael,
with the exception of the intrepid surgeon
and the almoner, it is the women
who hold the position. Originally the
city hospital, it was taken over by the
army at the beginning of the war. An
immense building with modern equipment
and a capacity for 700 patients, it has
been necessary of late to evacuate many
of the sections because of the increasing
frequency of the bombardments. The
hospital has been struck many times
and one ward completely destroyed. As
it happened there were no soldiers in
that section, it being used as a maternity
hospital for the city. Several women
and little children were killed and also
the sister in charge, Sister St. Etienne,
so dear to her co-workers that she is
never spoken of without tears. She had
just finished her rounds for the night
when the alarm came. Her one thought
was to save her ward from panic. A
bomb crashing through the roof hurled
a beam across the sister, killing her instantly
and wrecking the entire wing.</p>

<h3>"FOR ALL AMERICAN WOMEN"</h3>

<p>In spite of this tragedy and of recurring
attacks, the other sisters and the
head nurse, Mlle. Guyot, have held their
posts with quiet heroism and have never
lost an hour's duty. The patients now
are mostly convalescent, because fresh
cases are no longer brought there.</p>

<p>The supplies of shirts, pajamas, and
bandages sent from America were gratefully
commented upon by Mlle. Guyot,
and I was touched by similar expressions
from the men. One poor aviator, terribly
burned, but recovering, put up a
bandaged hand and saluted me "for all
American women." Another poilu wove
for me a table mat of red, white, and
blue cord. All were fervent in their good
wishes.</p>

<p>Everywhere warmth and order prevailed,
from the wards where the bandaged
soldiers sat about with their pipes
and their knitting to the big bakery where
the fragrant brown bread is baked and
to the kitchens with their caldrons of
broth and crisp roasts of meat.</p>

<p>Dry, well ventilated "abris" or bomb
shelters have been built in connection
with each section of the hospital. The
surgeon, who sleeps in a cellar near the
centre, is the first to assist his patients
to shelter in case of an alarm. There,
underground, long games of cards are
played on the brink of the unknown. This
is not callousness, but is done with deliberate
intent by the clever surgeon, (a
refugee from Lille,) knowing that by
this means his men may be saved a nervous
strain which might prove fatal.</p>

<p>Mlle. Guyot, who has been at the hospital
since the beginning of the war,
knows as well as any one what the city
has endured. It was she who said to me:</p>

<p>"I shall never forget that Dunkirk
<a class="pagenum" id="page_510" title="pg 510"> </a>
has borne the weight of the war from
the first day; that she has seen the exodus
of the Belgian population, to whom
she has given refuge as well as to the
people of the Department du Nord; that
she has known the passing of innumerable
armies going and coming from
the Yser; that in October, 1914, she began
to be bombarded, having at the same
time to fulfill the immense duty of bringing
in and caring for the wounded from
that immortal battlefield; and through it
all I have seen Dunkirk living and working
and saving with a smile!"</p>

<p>The military position of Dunkirk is
sometimes confusing because it has been
alternately on the French and English
fronts. The English are now retiring,
but sentinels of three nationalities still
guard the city gates; English Tommy
and French poilu stand with their arms
across each other's shoulders, the Belgian
stands apart.</p>

<p>On the sands of Malo, which is but a
prolongation of Dunkirk, with a sweeping
beach toward the North Sea, strange
men from Tonquin were digging trenches&mdash;dark
men branded by the sun and the
mark of the East, with warm dabs of
color on their high cheekbones, and small
opaque eyes under rising brows. The
uniform of the French Colonial is often
a medley. He looks as though he had
begun "dressing up" like children in
the attic, and as though his mind had
fallen short of his expectations. Out
on those bleak sands his touches of rich
blue, crimson, and green had almost the
fervor of stained glass set against the
dark and sinister sea. To the north the
Belgian coast cut the background with a
livid streak of sand.</p>

<p>In spite of the moving figures, the
loneliness was as of the ends of the
earth. The silence was accentuated
rather than broken by the purr of the
cannon and the mewing of a stray gull
slapped sidewise by the wind. But it is
thus that I like to think of Dunkirk&mdash;scourged
by the wind, blotted out by the
storm, knowing that for the time being
her stout hearts are safe.</p>

<p>As the sea has been the life of Dunkirk
in the past, so it will be its resurrection.
The city cannot be struck a
deathblow from the land side as has
many another less favorably situated.
But what a unique prot&eacute;g&eacute; for some god-mothering
American city to help re-establish
through her sympathy and aid!</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that France has just
included in the arms of Dunkirk the following
legend in addition to the one
gained by the naval battle of 1793:
"Ville heroique, sert d'exemple &agrave; toute
la nation"?</p>

<h2>Brutal Treatment of Italian Prisoners</h2>

<p class="drop">Sworn statements from British soldiers
returned from German prison
camps and hospitals received by Reuter's
Agency (the Associated Press of Great
Britain) indicate that systematic brutality
is practiced there upon Italian
prisoners. Lance Corporal Horace Hills,
7th Suffolk Regiment, made the following
statement under oath:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Five or six thousand Italians came in.
They had traveled three or four days,
and had had nothing at all to eat. After
they arrived soup was brought in, and, as
they were starving, they rushed at it.
The Germans then dashed forward and
stabbed them with their swords and bayonets,
and killed and wounded a lot. Seven
or eight Italians were dying every day in
the camp of starvation. They had no parcels.
I saw an Englishmen give an Italian
bread, and the Italian went down on
his knees and kissed his hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private J. F. Jackson, King's Liverpool
Regiment, swore:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One Italian told me they had been fifteen
days on the journey and had only
three meals all the time. Our hospital
lager was separated from the camp by
barbed wire; we took some bread and
threw it over the wire to the Italians;
they all began to grab for it, but a lot of
Germans rushed up and drew their bayonets
and flourished them in the air in a
threatening manner, and kicked and threw
the Italians about, and got the bread for
themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At Friedrichsfeld the treatment of the
Italians was equally barbarous, the sentries
shooting them for trying to get
food from the British. Equally revolting
stories come from Ohrdrup, Nammelburgh,
Stendal, Soltau, Limburg, and
Hamburg.

<h2>Germany's Attempt to Divide Belgium</h2>

<h3>Official Summary of Recent Political Events in
Flanders, Issued by the Belgian Foreign Office</h3>

<p><i>Germany's plan to divide Belgium by organizing a small group of "activists"
to establish a so-called Council of Flanders for the purpose of separating the Flemish
from the Walloon Provinces, was described in the April issue of <span class="smcap">Current History
Magazine</span>, pp. 91-96, along with the fearless opposition which the attempt created.
The following summary of the case, with a fuller array of dates and details, has
since been prepared by the Belgian Foreign Office at St. Adresse, France, the seat
of King Albert's Government in exile:</i></p>

<p class="drop">The semi-official Wolff Agency in
Berlin announced on Jan. 20, 1918,
that the so-called Council of Flanders
had proclaimed the autonomy
of Flanders Dec. 22, 1917. Soon after
that action, which had passed unnoticed
and had left Belgian opinion indifferent
and scornful, Herr von Walraff, German
Secretary of the Interior, had judged
the time opportune for a trip to Belgium,
(Jan. 1, 1918.) The "council," after getting
into close relations with him, had
taken up the decree which the Landtag
had intrusted to him on the 4th of February
preceding, and had declared that it
would submit itself to a popular referendum.</p>

<p>At length a commission of executive
officials was created; it included heads
for the Departments of the Interior,
Agriculture, Public Works, Arts and Sciences,
Justice, Finance, Labor, National
Defense, Posts and Telegraph, and the
Navy. The German telegraphic agencies
sent out this news in all directions to
spread the idea that Flanders was showing
an intention of detaching itself from
Belgium, and to give the impression of a
spontaneous popular movement for political
separation.</p>

<p>The thought that inspired this intrigue
dates back to a period almost two years
earlier. On April 5, 1916, the German
Chancellor, in defining the war aims of
Germany before the Reichstag, had outlined
the imperial policy of establishing a
protectorate over the Flemings. Later
there were found in Belgium some obscure
and discredited citizens who, betraying
their sacred duty, placed themselves
in the pay of the enemy and consented
to make themselves the agents and
accomplices of the invaders.</p>

<h3>GERMAN ACT OF SEPARATION</h3>

<p>On Feb. 4, 1917, an assembly composed
of 200 Belgians speaking the Flemish
language met and voted for the creation
of a "Council of Flanders." On
March 3 this body sent a deputation to
Berlin, and the Chancellor announced to
it that "the policy tending toward the
administrative separation would be pursued
with all the vigor possible during
the occupation," and that "during the
negotiations and after the conclusion of
peace the empire would not cease to
watch over the development of the Flemish
race." The German decrees dividing
Belgium into two administrative regions
followed close upon these declarations,
(March 21, 1917.)</p>

<p>At the end of 1917 the German authorities
believed that the moment had come
to consummate the enterprise by completing
the administrative separation
with a political separation. Thus the end
would be attained: Belgium would be dismembered;
one part of the country would
fall under vassalage to Germany, and,
in case there were no annexation, would
become in a way a sphere of influence
for the empire.</p>

<p>The intrigues of the "Council of Flanders"
are merely a comedy intended to
mask this policy. The policy rests upon
a clever juggling with the question of
languages. Under cover of the principle
of free self-determination of peoples, it
seeks to internationalize an internal problem
<a class="pagenum" id="page_512" title="pg 512"> </a>
in the hope of dislocating the Belgian
nationality. Perhaps it also aims at the
creation of a fictitious Government which
shall furnish the German Government
with the means for opening fallacious
peace negotiations to deceive the world
and weaken the cohesion of the Allies.
Many German newspapers have allowed
these aims to appear, and some have
boldly unveiled them.</p>

<h3>ALL BELGIUM PROTESTS</h3>

<p>But the strong protests of Flemish
communities and of the entire Belgian
Nation have foiled these plans, and the
news coming from the occupied region
enables us to determine with precision
the character of the r&ocirc;le played by the
"Council of Flanders." At the same time
it attests the determination of the Belgian
people to repel all foreign interference
and to maintain its unity unshaken.</p>

<p>What is this "Council of Flanders"?
It has no representative character. It
was created by a private assembly which
had no mandate from the people. It now
pretends to seek popular sanction
through an election. This is only a subterfuge.
There has been no election.
There has been no consultation of the
people. The promoters have limited
themselves to assembling groups of adherents
in theatres or restaurants, and
causing gatherings composed of their
proselytes, with an admixture of the
curious and the idle, to vote on lists of
candidates previously arranged in the
private offices of those who are directing
the work.</p>

<p>The Deputies and Senators, in a protest
to the Chancellor, thus denounced
the pretense of an election that was organized
in Brussels:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A meeting was called at a day's notice
in an exhibition hall. Everybody entered
who wished to, Belgians or strangers,
men, women, and children. There were
in all 600 or 700 persons. It was these
unknown persons, come together by
chance, without control or guarantee, that
in a few moments, as an interlude in a
speech, proclaimed the election of twenty-two
Deputies to the "Council of Flanders"
and fifty-two Provincial Councilors,
Such was the expression&mdash;without
the knowledge of the people&mdash;of the will
of the Municipality of Brussels, which
has 200,000 electors and almost 1,000,000
inhabitants.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>PROTESTS OF CITY COUNCILS</h3>

<p>Foreign occupation has not wholly destroyed
legitimate and regular representation
in Belgium. The Provincial
Councils and the City Councils are still
functioning. The administrative framework
of the country survives. The
municipal organization, so solidly rooted,
has not ceased to exercise power. The
Provincial and Municipal Councilors, like
the Deputies and Senators, most of whom
remain in the country, have been elected
by universal, direct, and secret suffrage.
They alone in the occupied territory are
competent to express the true national
opinion, and that opinion is strikingly
voiced in the protest of the Flemish and
Walloon members of Parliament, in that
of the Common Councils of the capital
and the large cities of Antwerp and
Ghent, whose example has been followed
by an increasing number of prominent
citizens and local Governments of smaller
towns in Flanders.</p>

<p>It has been demonstrated that the
"Council of Flanders" is pursuing an
enterprise of usurpation, that it is a tool
of the invader, and that its members are
in reality only agents of the German
authorities. They went to Berlin a year
ago to ask for administrative separation.
Herr von Walraff met them at Brussels
at the beginning of 1918 to arrange for
political separation. When Tack and
Borms were arrested by the Belgian
police on the order of Belgian Magistrates
it was the German functionaries
who, by force, compelled their release,
and they came out of prison by the side
of the German officer who had liberated
them. It was the Kommandantur of
Antwerp that ordered the communal administration,
disregarding its resistance,
to authorize the "activist" demonstration
of Feb. 3, and to have this protected
by the police, in violation of orders of
the Burgomaster that had been in force
nearly four years. It was the German
military headquarters, too, that forbade
all demonstrations of other groups and
commandeered the hall of the Chamber
of Commerce, placing it at the disposition
<a class="pagenum" id="page_513" title="pg 513"> </a>
of the organizers of a demonstration
judged by the Burgomaster to be one to
wound public sentiment and endanger
the public peace.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>At length Governor General von Falkenhausen
stamped the "Council of
Flanders" with the seal of German investiture,
deciding by a decree of Jan. 18,
1918, (published Feb. 10,) that the appointment
of the "council's" delegates
was subject to his ratification, and that
these delegates were called to collaborate
with him in his legislative labors.</p>

<p>Thus one has the right to conclude that
the whole organism of the "Council of
Flanders" is only a foreign tool to serve
the enemy in his designs of division and
oppression. The delegates of the council
cannot pretend to any independence, since
the decree of Jan. 18 reduces them to
the r&ocirc;le of functionaries of German authority,
named by that authority and expected
to contribute, by their advice, to
its political work.</p>

<h3>THE DELEGATES OSTRACIZED</h3>

<p>The Belgian people, without distinction
of language, party, or condition, have, by
impressive demonstrations, repudiated
the faithless citizens who, joining hands
with the enemy, have arrogated to themselves
the right to speak in the name of
the Flemings. The Flemings were the
first to condemn the crime. To the protests
of the Deputies and Senators and
of the City Councils have been added
those of the leading intellectual and political
societies of Flanders. The Flemish
Academy raised its voice to "affirm its
fidelity to the Belgian Fatherland and its
King." The Belgian Labor Party proclaimed
that "not one of the 800 labor
groups composing it, and not one of its
authorized leaders, had been led astray
or corrupted by the activist-separatist
movement, either in Flanders or in
Wallonia."</p>

<p>In the streets of Antwerp, of Malines,
of Brussels, spontaneous uprisings which
the German troops could not suppress
voiced the scorn and anger of the crowds.</p>

<p>Crowning this expression of the popular
will and giving it the sanction of law,
the Brussels Court of Appeals, acting
upon the protest of the Deputies and Senators,
at a plenary sitting of all its united
chambers, [Feb. 7, 1918,] ordered a hearing
which ended in the arrest of delegates
of the "Council of Flanders" on a charge
of conspiracy against the form of the
State, interference with public functions,
and wicked attacks against the constitutional
authority of the King, the rights
of the chambers, and the laws of the nation.
When the German authorities, protecting
the guilty ones and acting in the
guise of vengeance, caused the arrest of
the Presidents of the Court, who had
come in the august garb of justice to do
their duty, the Court of Cassation, by a
decree of Feb. 11, decided unanimously
to suspend its sittings; the Courts of
Appeals in Ghent and Li&eacute;ge, with all the
courts of first instance and the courts
of commerce, followed its example. The
civic heroism of a whole people is summed
up in that impressive gesture. There is
no more eloquent page in history.</p>

<p>This nation can remain free. It stoically
endures the presence and domination
of the enemy in its territory. The foreign
occupation that has lasted three and
a half years has not broken its spirit or
its will to resistance. The Flemish, like
the Walloon communities, victims of the
most frightful brutalities, subjected to a
system of forced labor, decimated by deportations,
have remained immovably
faithful to King and country. The moral
unity of the nation has continued intact.</p>

<h3>FLEMISH QUESTION NOT NEW</h3>

<p>The Flemish question does not imperil
this unity. It dates much further back
than the war and has often been a subject
of lively debate. It is a question of
interior policy which the nation alone
must solve, after the war, independently,
under its own free constitutional powers.
Belgium has had the same Constitution
since 1831, and has not dreamed of altering
its principles, unless we except the
proclamation of universal manhood suffrage
in 1893. In eighty-three years of
peace and prosperity there was not a
single political party that cast doubt
upon the validity of the fundamental
<a class="pagenum" id="page_514" title="pg 514"> </a>
charter&mdash;an eloquent proof of its plastic
vitality and perfect harmony with the
deepest needs of the nation's collective
existence.</p>

<p>Equality before the law, (Article 6,)
individual liberty, (Articles 7, 8, 9, 10,)
liberty of religious faith, (Articles 14
and 15,) freedom in education, (Article
17,) freedom of the press, (Article 18,)
the right of assembly, (Article 19,) liberty
of association, (Article 20,) freedom
as to language, (Article 21)&mdash;these are
the essential axioms on which the nation's
public life is based.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Belgian Constitution, after guaranteeing
respect for these fundamental
principles, regulates the exercise of political
powers, all of which, it declares,
"emanate from the nation." (Article 25.)
"The legislative power is exercised jointly
by the King, the House of Representatives,
and the Senate." (Article 26.)
The Deputies are elected directly by all
the Belgian citizens who are 25 years old
and who have lived at least one year in
the commune, those who fulfill certain
requirements of knowledge or capacity
being allowed one or two supplementary
votes. (Article 47.) Senators are elected
on the same principles, with the difference
that the voters must be at least 30
years old. The Senate also includes a
certain number of members elected by
the Provincial Councils. (Article 53.)
For both chambers the voting is obligatory
and secret, and the division of seats
is arranged on a system of proportional
representation that safeguards the rights
of minorities. Subject to the responsibility
of his Ministers the King exercises
the executive power. (Articles 63 and 64.)</p>

<p>Judicial power is exercised through
courts whose members are not subject to
removal. (Articles 99 and 100.) A jury
alone can deal with criminal cases, political
charges, and indictments brought
against the press. (Article 98.)</p>

<p>Finally, side by side with the three
great political branches, the provincial
and communal Governments deal with all
matters of local interest. Chief among
them are&mdash;for the commune: the City
Council, elected by direct vote, and the
"College of Burgomasters and Aldermen,"
whose members are chosen by
the Common Council, with the exception
of the Burgomaster, who is appointed by
the King; and for the province: the Provincial
Council, directly elected, the
"Permanent Deputation," elected by the
Provincial Council, and the Governor,
who represents the National Government.</p>

<h3>SETTLING THE LANGUAGE ISSUE</h3>

<p>This rapid sketch suffices to show the
democratic and liberal nature of the Belgian
Governmental system. Such institutions
permit of free discussion and facilitate
the peaceful solution of the most
irritating internal problems. As the protest
of the Flemish societies puts it, "The
Flemings are not a conquered nation;
they have the same electoral right as the
Walloons; they have all the means for
safeguarding their just rights."</p>

<p>Belgium has always lived an intense
life, yet this has never compromised its
unity. Three great parties, the Catholic,
the Liberal, the Socialist, struggle for
preponderance, and their action extends
to all parts of the country without distinction
of language. Each of them supports
an identical program, in Flanders
as in Wallonia, regardless of whether the
citizens speak Flemish or French. The
party lines have never corresponded with
the linguistic lines. In each are found
leaders of the Flemish movement, whose
aspirations have given rise to many
speeches, but have never been repudiated
as anti-patriotic. This movement is thus
described by the Flemish societies in their
protest against the "Council of Flanders:"
It is the expression of the
fundamental principle that every population
possesses the inalienable right to
develop itself according to its own character
and its own language, life, and
historic personality." But it remains
essentially national and declares itself,
in the document just cited, unalterably
hostile to the separation of the country
into two Governments with two capitals,
two Ministries, two Parliaments. The
<a class="pagenum" id="page_515" title="pg 515"> </a>
Flemish societies see in separation only
"a weakening that will lead to a catastrophe
for the Flemings, as well as for
the Walloons." They add:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our most sacred political and economic
interests are menaced by these absurd
plans. The organic whole which has made
of Belgium, through its commerce and industry,
its rivers, ports and railways,
its agriculture and workingmen, all working
together under a single Government
through scores of years, an economic
power of the first order, would be dissolved,
artificially weakened by contradictory
influences, enervated by divergent
official policies. The narrow particularism
which in the past and present has done
so much harm would dominate. The balance
between the different political, religious,
and social tendencies in our country
would be destroyed, and Belgium
would be left in a state of crisis which,
through long years, would render almost
impossible the relief of the country and
the curing of the wounds caused by the
war.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>RIGHTS OF FLEMISH TONGUE</h3>

<p>In the years before the war the Belgian
Parliament passed several laws intended
to assure to the Flemish language the
place that belongs to it in the national
life, especially in the administrative,
judicial, and educational departments.
It will suffice to recall the law of May
12, 1910, on secondary schools, and the
law of July 2, 1913, on languages in the
army, making a knowledge of Flemish
and French obligatory for admission to
the National Military School. At the
moment when the war broke out the
Parliament was considering a proposition
tending to organize Flemish high schools,
and in a report to the King, Oct. 8, 1916,
the Government declared itself "convinced
that immediately upon the re-establishment
of peace a general agreement
of favorable sentiments, which it
will try to promote, will assure to the
Flemings, both in the higher schools and
in all the others, that complete equality,
in right and in fact, which ought to exist
under the guarantees of our Constitution."
(Moniteur, Oct. 8-14, 1916.)</p>

<p>Only after the war can the Government
solve the problems arising out of
the Flemish movement. The promoters
of that movement themselves deplore the
intervention of an alien power and scorn
the traitors who have conspired with the
enemy, accepting money and positions at
his hand. It is as loyal Belgian citizens,
they declare, that they are striving for
reforms from which they expect a fuller
intellectual development of Flemish communities,
and they see in such culture a
new force of unity for the nation, from
which they by no means wish to be separated.</p>

<h3>BELGIAN PREMIER'S VIEW</h3>

<p><i>Baron de Broqueville, the Belgian
Prime Minister, said to a correspondent
of The London Times:</i></p>

<p>The Belgian people, after three and a
half years of the most grinding oppression,
have shown by the courageous defiance
of enemy bayonets which brought
about the collapse of the "activist" plot,
that they have lost none of their sturdy
resolve to be free; that the spirit which
moved them to reject the German ultimatum
of Aug. 2, 1914, is as strong as
ever. * * *</p>

<p>Only one thing is worrying and humiliating
in a quite special degree all
Belgians in occupied territory. It is the
fear lest abroad it may be imagined that
there really is an "activist" movement
in Belgium. All the reports we have
received on this point amount to this:
"No one in Belgium talks of this alleged
movement, for it is nonexistent. There
are a few miserable individuals in German
pay&mdash;always the same&mdash;who intrigue
and plot. All they have achieved
is to arouse against them such feelings
of repulsion and hate that they have been
thrust forever forth from the nation, and
nothing can cleanse them of their crime.
For mercy's sake, beg people not to insult
us by treating the agitation of these
individuals seriously, and to stop seeing
any agitation where there is nothing but
the work of a few paid traitors.</p>

<p>It is in this sense that our compatriots
write to us from behind the German barrier.
There, as elsewhere, the most
ardent advocates of Flemish claims reject
foreign interference in internal policy,
and they treat as traitors to the cause
all those who accept bribes from the torturers

<h2>Stripping Belgian Industries</h2>

<h3>Germany's Use of the "Rathenau Plan" for the
Exploitation of Belgium and Northern France</h3>

<p class="drop">The German Government from the
beginning of the war has systematically
stripped the factories
of Belgium and other conquered
territory with the purpose, it is charged,
of crippling industries in those countries,
not only as a war measure, but as an
economic means of preventing future
competition. This phase of German war
policy is treated in a brochure edited by
Professors Dana C. Munro of Princeton,
George C. Sellery of the University of
Wisconsin, and August C. Krey of the
University of Minnesota. It is issued by
the United States Committee on Public
Information under the title, "German
Treatment of Conquered Territory." The
editors find their text in this statement
by Deputy Beumer, made before the
Prussian Diet in February, 1917:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Anybody who knows the present state
of things in Belgian industry will agree
with me that it will take at least some
years&mdash;assuming that Belgium is independent
at all&mdash;before Belgium can even
think of competing with us in the world
market. And anybody who has traveled,
as I have done, through the occupied districts
of France, will agree with me that
so much damage has been done to industrial
property that no one need be a
prophet in order to say that it will take
more than ten years before we need think
of France as a competitor or of the re-establishment
of French industry.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This exploitation for the benefit of
German industry is an outgrowth of the
plan suggested early in August, 1914, by
Dr. Walter Rathenau, President of the
General Electric Company of Germany,
to establish a Bureau of Raw Materials
for the War. The bureau (Kriegsrohstoffabtheilung)
was made a part of the
Ministry of War. Its operation in the
occupied territories was explained in a
lecture by Dr. Rathenau in April, 1916,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was necessary to be sure of an increase
in the reserve of raw materials
both by purchase in neutral countries and
by monopolizing all stocks found in the
occupied territory of the enemy. * * *
The occupation of Belgium, of the most
valuable industrial parts of France, as
well as of parts of Russia, made a new
task for the organization. It was necessary
to make use of the stocks of raw
material of these three territories for the
domestic economy of the war, to use, especially,
the stores of wool found at the
centres of the Continental wool market.
Valuable stocks of rubber and of saltpeter
were to be used for the profit of the
manufacturer at home. The difficulties
that are met with in keeping to the rules
of war while making these requisitions
have been overcome. A system of collecting
stations, of depots and of organizations
for distribution was arranged
which solved the difficulties of transportation,
infused new blood into industry at
home, and gave it a firmer and more
secure basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>BRAND WHITLOCK'S STATEMENT</h3>

<p>This plan, which has given German industry
"a firmer and more secure basis,"
was used not merely to "make war support
war" by contributions wrung from
the conquered peoples, but also to destroy
future competition&mdash;in violation of The
Hague Convention, (Articles 46, 52, 53,)
which Germany had signed. In the first
months of the war a pretense was still
made of acting under military necessity,
but this was soon abandoned. On March
4, 1915, Brand Whitlock, American Minister
to Belgium, reported to the State
Department:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Federation of Belgian Steel and Iron
Manufacturers forwarded a protest to the
German Governor General in Belgium, on
Jan. 22, 1915, complaining that the German
authorities have invaded the Belgian
plants and seized the machinery and tools,
which have been taken to pieces and sent
to Germany in great number; in many
cases no receipt was left in the hands of
the legitimate owner to prove the nature,
number, and value of the seized tools.
Machinery to the value of 16,000,000 francs
($3,000,000) had been taken away up to
Jan. 22.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Feldzeugmeisterei in
Berlin has entered into a contract with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_517" title="pg 517"> </a>
the firm Sonnenthal Junior of Cologne,
which firm is to collect, transport, and
deliver to German manufactories of war
supplies all engines and tools seized in
Belgium and France, and to bring them
back after the war is over.</p>

<p>This contract provides, also, that the
Sonnenthal Company has the right and
even is compelled, in co-operation with the
gun foundry at Li&eacute;ge, to pick out in factories
of the occupied territory those machines
which seem most useful for the
manufacture of German war supplies and
to propose the seizure of the machinery.</p>

<p>The Royal Belgian Government protests,
with indignation, against these measures,
which constitute a clear violation of Article
53 of the regulations of the Fourth
Hague Convention. The items enumerated
in Article 53 are limited and neither the
seizure nor the transport to another
country of machinery and tools used in
industry are permitted; these implements
must always be respected when they are
private property, (Article 46.)</p>

<p>By the removal of these tools, the efforts
made by the manufacturers in order
to maintain a certain activity in the
plants are nullified, numerous workmen
are obliged to remain idle and are facing
starvation. These measures will also retard
the restoration of industry after the
war is over.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the German authorities
disregard in a systematic way the prescriptions
of Article 52 of the above-mentioned
regulations of the Fourth
Hague Convention, which stipulate that
requisitions in nature from towns and
their inhabitants in the occupied territory
can only be permitted when they are directly
destined for the army of occupation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>UNJUST FINES</h3>

<p>A dispatch from Minister Whitlock
dated at Brussels, Aug. 2, 1915, gives a
fuller memorandum on the subject, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon the arrival of German troops at
Brussels, the city and communes of the
agglomeration were required to pay as a
war contribution the sum of 50,000,000
francs in gold, silver, or banknotes, the
Province of Brabant having to pay, in
addition, the sum of 450,000,000 francs, to
be delivered not later than Sept. 1, 1914.</p>

<p>The sum of 50,000,000 francs imposed on
the City of Brussels was reduced to
45,000,000 francs, but the city was later
subjected to a penalty of 5,000,000 francs
on the ground that two members of the
German Secret Service had been attacked
by the crowd without assistance having
been rendered by the Brussels police. On
this point it may be noted that when
Mr. Max, the Burgomaster, at the beginning
of the occupation, asked the German
authorities to inform him of the names
of the German secret police agents whom
they intended to employ, he was told that
there were no German secret police in
Brussels.</p>

<p>In December, 1914, a contribution of
480,000,000 francs, payable at the rate of
40,000,000 a month, was imposed on the
provinces.</p>

<p>At the beginning of April, 1915, a fine
of 500,000 marks was imposed on the City
of Brussels, which refused to repair the
road between Brussels and Antwerp&mdash;a
State road the repair of which devolved
upon the State. But the German authorities
had taken over the State moneys,
and should, therefore, have assumed the
expense of the work. Furthermore, this
road is entirely outside of the territory
of the City of Brussels, and, finally, the
city had not the administration for the
maintenance or construction of roads, and
had neither material nor personnel to
carry on such work.</p>

<p>On Jan. 16, 1915, on Belgians who had
voluntarily left the country and had not
returned by March 1, 1915, tenfold advance
of personal tax was made; and
many taxes were imposed on communes
as indemnity for damages claimed by German
citizens to have been suffered
through acts of the inhabitants at the
time war was declared.</p>

<p>When the German Army arrived in
Brussels, it requisitioned for the daily
support of the troops 18,000 kilos of
wheat, 10,000 kilos of fresh meat, 6,000
kilos of rice, 10,000 kilos of sugar, and
72,000 kilos of oats. Similar requisitions
were made, in all cities in which the German
troops camped. The requisitions,
however, exceeded the needs of the troops
in passing or in occupation, and a large
part of the requisitioned supplies was
sent to Germany.</p>

<p>At Louvain the German authorities requisitioned
250,000 francs' worth of canned
vegetables and at Malines about 4,000,000
francs' worth.</p>

<p>In Flanders and in part of Hainault the
farmers were despoiled of almost all their
horses and cattle and the little wheat
and grain remaining. The little village
of Middleburg, for instance, which numbers
850 inhabitants, after having given
up 50 cows, 35 hogs, and 1,600 kilos of
oats, was forced to furnish in January
and February, 1915, 100 hogs, 100,000 kilos
of grain, 50,000 kilos of beans or peas,
50,000 kilos of oats, and 150,000 kilos of
straw.</p>

<p>At Ghent and Antwerp the German authorities
found about 40,000 tons of oil-cake,
necessary for the feeding of cattle
in Winter, and seized it.</p>

<p>They also carried off several hundred
thousand tons of phosphates from Belgium
for use in Germany.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_518" title="pg 518"> </a></p>

<p>Walnut trees on private properties, as
well as on State lands, were cut down and
requisitioned.</p>

<p>Besides, draught horses&mdash;the result of a
rational selection carried on through more
than a century and probably the most
perfect Belgian agricultural product&mdash;were
carried off throughout all Belgium.
Not only did the German Army requisition
horses necessary for its wagons, mounts
for its troops or artillery service, but it
carried away from the Belgian stock
horses absolutely unfit for military service,
which were sent to Germany. The
same is true as regards the cattle.</p>

<p>All crude materials indispensable for
Belgian industries were requisitioned and
sent to Germany&mdash;leather, hides, copper,
wool, flax, &amp;c. Furthermore, if not the
entire stock, at least the greatest number
possible of machinery parts, were shipped
to Germany to be used, according to
German statements, in making munitions
which the Belgian factories had refused to
produce.</p>

<p>At Antwerp, requisitions of all kinds of
materials and products were considerable,
notably:</p>

<p>Cottons in large quantities&mdash;one house
having been requisitioned to the amount
of 1,300,000 francs. Other enormous requisitions
were made on shop depots, &amp;c.,
and are impossible of computation just
now.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>PAYMENT WITHHELD</h3>

<p>The requisitions from Antwerp, which
Mr. Whitlock enumerates, were the subject
of a protest by the Acting President
of the Antwerp Chamber of Commerce on
March 18, 1915. He valued these goods
at more than 83,000,000 francs ($16,600,000)
and stated that only 20,000,000
francs ($4,000,000) had been paid by the
German authorities. The reply of Governor
General von Bissing on Sept. 24
shows that up to that time payment had
not been made. The reason is indicated
in the following statement of German
policy, published in the Frankfurter
Zeitung Dec. 21, 1914:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The raw materials which the Imperial
Government has bought in Antwerp,
Ghent, and other places will be paid for
as soon as possible. The payment will be
made only after the goods have been
transported into Germany and after the
valuation has been made, and <i>the payment
shall be made in such manner that no
money shall be sent from Germany to Belgium
during the period of the war</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Professor Munro and his fellow-editors
have drawn freely upon the official texts
printed in the work entitled "German
Legislation for the Occupied Territories
of Belgium," edited, in ten volumes, by
Huberich and Nicol-Speyer, (The Hague,
1915-17.) These volumes cover the period
from Sept. 5, 1914, to March 29,
1917, and contain a reprint of "The Official
Bulletin of Laws and Ordinances"
in German, French, and Flemish. The
documents show that the first step under
the Rathenau plan was to ascertain what
raw materials and other supplies were
accessible. Consequently, there were
many ordinances commanding the declaration
of certain wares. The following
is an example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">Brussels, Dec. 11, 1914.</p>

<p>All stocks of benzine, benzol, petroleum,
spirits of alcohol, glycerine, oils and fats
of any kind, toluol, carbide, raw rubber
and rubber waste, as well as all automobile
tires, shall immediately be reported
in writing to the respective chiefs of districts
or commanders, with a statement
of quantity and the place of storage. * * *</p>

<p>If a report is not made the wares shall
be confiscated for the State and the guilty
individual shall be punished by the military
authorities. (<i>From "German Legislation,"
&amp;c., Vol. I., p. 95.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a declaration made it easy for
the military authorities later to acquire
the wares either by direct requisition or
by forced sales. The following are examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">Brussels, Aug. 13, 1915.</p>

<p>Article 1. The stocks of chicory roots
existing within the jurisdiction of the General
Government in Belgium are hereby
commandeered. (<i>From "German Legislation,"
&amp;c., Vol. IV., p. 148.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">Brussels, Jan. 8, 1916.</p>

<p>Article 1. All wools (raw wool, washed
wool, tops and noils, woolen waste, woolen
yarns, artificial wools, as well as mixtures
of these articles with others) and
also all mattresses filled with the wools
above specified and now an object of trade
<a class="pagenum" id="page_519" title="pg 519"> </a>
or introduced into trade, found within the
jurisdiction of the General Government,
are hereby commandeered.</p>

<p>Wool freshly shorn or in any other way
separated from the skin shall also be subject
to seizure immediately upon its separation.
(<i>From "German Legislation,"
&amp;c., Vol. VI., p. 57.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Between October, 1914, and March,
1917, there were ninety-two separate
ordinances of the General Government
commanding the declaration, forced sale,
or confiscation of various materials. Of
these, forty-five were issued in 1915 and
thirty-five in 1916. How these decrees
passed by rapid evolution from mere
declaration to complete confiscation is
instanced in these typical examples:</p>

<p>1. A decree issued at Brussels July 19,
1916, lists several pages of textile materials
which are to be declared.</p>

<p>2. A decree of Aug. 22, 1916, enlarges
the preceding list.</p>

<p>3. A decree drawn up July 19, 1916,
but not published till Sept. 12, 1916, declares
75 per cent. of this material subject
to seizure by the Milit&auml;risches Textil-Beschaffungsamt.</p>

<p>4. Later decrees of seizure cover materials
overlooked in these.</p>

<h3>STRIPPING BELGIUM OF METALS</h3>

<p>Every scrap of metal in the conquered
countries that could possibly be seized
has been confiscated. The ordinance
below is given as an example of the
thoroughness of the system of requisitions.
The prices to be paid were entirely
too low, and the sixth section shows
that the owners were not expected to part
with their property willingly. The
ordinance was issued at Brussels Dec. 13,
1916:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SECTION I. The following designated
objects are hereby seized and must be
delivered.</p>

<p>SECTION II. Movable and fixed household
articles made of copper, tin, nickel,
brass, bronze or tombac, whatever their
state:</p>

<p>1. Kitchen utensils, metal ware, and
household utensils, except cutlery.</p>

<p>2. Wash basins, bathtubs, warm-water
heaters and reservoirs.</p>

<p>3. Individual or firm name plates in and
on the houses, doorknobs, knockers, and
metal decorations on doors and carriages
not necessary for locking.</p>

<p>4. Curtain rods and holders and stair
carpet fixtures.</p>

<p>5. Scales.</p>

<p>6. All other household articles or adornments
made of tin.</p>

<p>The articles included under the numerals
1-6 are subject to seizure and delivery
even when not contained in households in
the narrow sense, but in other inhabited
or uninhabited buildings and rooms, (<i>e. g.</i>,
offices of authorities, office rooms in factories
and entries.)</p>

<p>SECTION III. Exempt from seizure
and delivery:</p>

<p>1. Articles on and in churches and other
buildings and rooms dedicated to religious
services.</p>

<p>2. Articles in hospitals and clinics, as
well as in the private offices of physicians,
apothecaries, and healers, so far
as these articles are essential to the care
of the sick or the practice of medicine
and cannot be replaced.</p>

<p>3. Articles in public buildings.</p>

<p>4. Articles which are part of commercial
or industrial stores either designated
for sale or useful in the business. For
these articles a special decree is enacted.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>SECTION IV. Procedure of seizure is
as follows:</p>

<p>All alteration of the articles subject to
seizure is forbidden. All judicial disposition
or change of ownership is interdicted,
except in so far as the following
paragraphs permit.</p>

<p>SECTION V. <i>Obligation to Deliver.</i> The
delivery of the seized articles must be
made at the time and places designated
by the Division of Trade and Industry;
it can also be made before the requisition
at the Zentral-Einkaufsgesellschaft for
Belgium. Upon delivery the ownership
of the articles is vested in the German
Military Administration.</p>

<p>Articles of artistic or historic value, if
so recognized by the Bureau of Delivery,
need not be delivered.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Delivery may, for unusual
cause, grant exemptions from delivery.</p>

<p>SECTION VI. <i>Indemnity.</i> The following
prices will be paid for the delivered
articles:</p>

<table class="list2" summary="Price List">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td class="tdr">Francs.</td>

<p>In arranging the weight, seizures of
nondesignated materials will not be included.</p>

<p>The payment will take place on the
basis of the estimate made by the Bureau
of Delivery. Payment will be made to
the deliverer without question of his ownership.</p>

<p>If the deliverer refuses to accept the
payment he will be given a receipt, and
the determination of the indemnity in this
case will follow through the Reichsentsch&auml;digungskommission
according to the rules in force.</p>

<p>SECTION VII. <i>Persons and Corporations
Affected by This Decree:</i></p>

<p>1. House owners, inhabitants and heads
of establishments.</p>

<p>2. Persons, associations, and corporations
of a private or public nature whose
buildings or rooms contain articles enumerated
in Section 2.</p>

<p>To this group, furthermore, belong also
State, Church, and community business
and industrial establishments, including
business, industrial, and office buildings
in the ownership, possession, or guardianship
of military and civil authorities.
For buildings abandoned or not occupied
by their owners or inhabitants, the communal
authorities are responsible for the
execution of this decree. The district
commanders are authorized to furnish
further instructions to the communities
in this case. If dwelling houses are occupied
as quarters by German military or
civil authorities the execution of this
order rests upon the military authorities
concerned.</p>

<p>SECTION VIII. <i>Confiscation.</i> [Failure
to comply with the provisions of the decree
entails confiscation.]</p>

<p>SECTION IX. <i>Co-operation of Communities.</i>
[Local authorities ordered to co-operate
in execution of this order.]</p>

<p>SECTION X. <i>Certificates of Exemption.</i>
[Verwaltungschef empowered to issue
certificates of exemption.]</p>

<p>SECTION XI. <i>Punishment for Violations.</i>
Any one who intentionally or
through gross negligence violates the
present decree or supplementary regulations
will be punished with imprisonment
not to exceed two years or a fine not to
exceed 20,000 marks, or both. Any one
who urges or incites others to violate the
present decree or its supplementary regulations
will be punished in like manner,
unless he has incurred graver punishment
under the general law. The attempt
is punishable. Military courts and
military authorities are empowered to try
cases. (<i>From "German Legislation,"
&amp;c., Vol. IX., pp. 398-394.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some industries which were not directly
useful to the Germans were at first allowed
to resume work in whole or in part,
for the Government did not wish to cut
off all sources of the enormous indemnities
which it was levying upon towns and
individuals. But the rival manufacturers
in Germany objected angrily against this
policy. Thus Dr. Goetze, head of the
German Glassmakers' Union, wrote in
the Wirtschaftzeitung der Zentralm&auml;chte,
Nov. 10, 1916:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has become vital to the German
manufacturers of glass wares that the
Belgian manufacturers should be stopped
from going to neutral markets, and it
must be admitted that the German Civil
Administration has fully recognized the
necessity of arranging this matter according
to the demands of the German
industry, and that it has taken suitable
action. [In spite of this some Belgian
shops were able to do some exporting and
had affected the market price.] Measures
must be taken to stop this. For this
reason the factories of Central and Eastern
Germany, which are most directly
concerned, have secured the promulgation
of an order stopping importation, transit,
and exportation. * * * We must demand
that the German Civil Administration of
Belgium should first of all look out for
the protection of the interests of the
German industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to securing the aid of the
German Government in ruining Belgian
industries which competed with them,
German manufacturers have also been
aided by the German Government in obtaining
Belgian trade secrets. For example,
Dr. Bronnert secured a permit
from the War Ministry to visit the factory
at Obourg for making artificial silk.
He took full notes of all that he could
learn when he visited it, on Dec. 9, 1916,
and carried away designs and parts of
the machinery. Dr. Bronnert is a director
of a German factory for making artificial
silk which competes with the Belgian factory.
(<i>From the "Informations Belges,"
No. 307.</i>)</p>

<h3>HAGUE REGULATIONS FLOUTED</h3>

<p>When Belgium attempted to protest
against the illegal requisitions, citing The
Hague regulations, they received answers
such as the following, which was read to
the Municipal Council and notables of
the town of Halluin, June 30, 1915:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gentlemen: What is happening is known
to all these gentlemen. It is the conception
and interpretation of Article 52 of
The Hague Convention which has created
<a class="pagenum" id="page_521" title="pg 521"> </a>
difficulties between you and the
German military authority. On which
side is the right? It is not for us to discuss
that, for we are not competent, and
we shall never arrive at an understanding
on this point. It will be the business of
the diplomatists and the representatives
of the various States after the war.</p>

<p>Today it is exclusively the interpretation
of German military authority which
is valid, and for that reason we intend
that all that we shall need for the maintenance
of our troops shall be made by
the workers of the territory occupied. I
can assure you that the German authority
will not under any circumstances desist
from demanding its rights, even if a
town of 15,000 inhabitants should have to
perish. The measures introduced up to
the present are only a beginning, and
every day severe measures will be taken
until our object is obtained.</p>

<p>This is the last word, and it is good advice
I give you tonight. Return to reason
and arrange for the workers to resume
work without delay; otherwise you
will expose your town, your families, and
your persons to the greatest misfortunes.</p>

<p>Today, and perhaps for a long time yet,
there is for Halluin neither a prefecture
nor a French Government. There is only
one will, and that is the will of German
authority.</p>

<h3>GERMANY'S PROFITS</h3>

<p>The German profits from the Rathenau
plan were summarized thus frankly by
Herr Ganghofer in an article published
in the M&uuml;nchener Neueste Nachrichten
Feb. 26, 1915:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For three months about four-fifths of
the army's needs were supplied by the
conquered country. Even now, although
the exhausted sources in the land occupied
by us are beginning to yield less
abundantly, the conquered territory is
still supplying two-thirds of the needs of
the German Army in the west. Because
of this, for the last four months the German
Empire has saved an average of
3,500,000 to 4,000,000 marks a day. This
profit which the Germans have secured
by their victory is very greatly increased
by another means. That is the economic
war which, in accordance with the rules
of international law, is being carried on
against the conquered land by the exhaustion
of the goods which belong to the
State, which are being carried to Germany
from Belgium and Northern France.
These are in enormous quantities and consist
of war booty, fortress supplies, grain,
wool, metal, expensive hardwood, and
other things, not including all private
property which cannot be requisitioned.
In case of necessity this private property
will, of course, be secured to increase the
German supply, but it will also be paid
for at its full value. What Germany
saves and gains by this economic war, carried
on in a businesslike way, can be
reckoned at a further 6,000,000 to 7,000,000
marks a day. Thus the entire profit
which the German Empire has made behind
its western front since the beginning
of the war can be estimated at about
2,000,000,000 marks. For Germany this is
a tremendous victory through the sparing
and increase in her economic power; for
the enemy it is a crushing defeat through
the exhaustion of all of the auxiliary
financial sources in those portions of his
territory which have been lost to us.</p>

<p>Of the branches and management of this
economic war I shall have more to say.
Then people will learn to banish to the
lumber room of the past the catch phrase
about "the unpractical German." A
German officer of high rank at St. Quentin
characterized this happy change which
has taken place in our favor in these half-serious,
half-humorous words: "It is
extraordinary how much a man learns!
Although in reality I am an officer of the
Potsdam Guard, now I am in the wool
and lumber business. And successful,
too!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Governor General von Bissing's testimony
on this subject, as recorded in his
"Testament," will be found in full in
<span class="smcap">Current History Magazine</span> for February,
1918, pp. 330-38. Among the passages
from it quoted in the pamphlet
here under review is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The advantages which we have been
able during the present war to obtain
from Belgian industry, by the removal of
machinery and so on, are as important
as the disadvantages which our enemies
have suffered through the lack of their
fighting strength.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>LANGHORNE'S DISPATCH</h3>

<p>That the systematic exploitation and
destruction in Flanders and Northern
France were still going on in the Fall of
1917 is shown by the following dispatch
from the American Charg&eacute; d'Affaires in
Holland:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">The Hague, Sept. 29, 1917.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Secretary of State, Washington:</span>  A
person who has recently arrived here from
Ghent gives the following information as
to conditions in East and West Flanders
and Northern France:</p>

<p>The looms and machinery are being
<a class="pagenum" id="page_522" title="pg 522"> </a>
taken away from the textile mills in
Roubaix and Tourcoing and sent to Germany.
Such machines as cannot be removed
and transported have in some instances
been dynamited, and in others
are being destroyed with hammers. In
the neighborhood of Courtrai in Flanders
all the mills have been ordered to furnish
a list of their machinery. The measures
which have been applied to the north of
France will be carried out in Flanders.
All textile fabrics have been requisitioned
by the military authorities, even in small
retail stores, and woolen blankets have
been taken from private houses. There is
also extensive requisitioning of wine. In
the larger cities in the course of the past
few weeks large numbers of children
of from 10 to 15 years have been
brought in for office work. There is a
rapid increase in the number of women
brought in for this purpose. A marked
animation was observed in the Etappen
inspection at Ghent last week. It is believed
that at the meeting of the inspection
something unusual was being discussed.</p>

<h3>DESTRUCTION STILL GOING ON</h3>

<p>That the Rathenau plan is still wringing
the remnants of industrial supplies
from Belgium in 1918 is shown by documents
still later than those printed in
the brochure just reviewed. In January
linen and mattresses were being taken
from hotels, boarding houses, and convents
all over Belgium. The inhabitants
were forbidden by law to have any wool
in their possession, but were offered a
substitute made of seaweed. The large
electrical plant at Antwerp known as
l'Escaut was stripped of its machinery,
which was transferred to a German
plant. Belgian kitchens did not escape.
The huge copper pans and kettles, the
glory of Belgian housewives, had to go
to Germany with the bright jars and
jugs of the milkmaids. Nearly every
conceivable brass, copper, and bronze object
had been requisitioned by that time.</p>

<p>The Belgian Government sent out a
statement on Feb. 17, 1918, containing
these passages:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The German authorities then aggravated
the evils of industrial stoppage by forbidding
public works and commandeering the
factories and metals and leather for military
purposes. After this they instituted
the barbarous system of deporting workmen
to perform forced labor in Germany,
a system which they had to interrupt officially,
after some months, because it
proved revolting to the conscience of mankind,
but only to substitute for it immediately
the forced labor of the civilian
population, in work of military value, by
the order of the military authorities. This
system is still being cruelly maintained in
the zones lying back of the fighting line
in the provinces of East and West Flanders,
Hainault, Namur, and Luxemburg.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the commandeering has become
general, and affects both natural
and manufactured products and also tools,
motors, and means of transportation,
whether mechanical or animal. Finally,
fiscal and administrative measures have
been taken to close the last remaining
outlets for Belgian products into neutral
countries.</p>

<p>These facts are incontestable. They are
proved by many rules and regulations
officially published by the German authorities.</p>

<p>At present the raid upon the last economic
resources of occupied Belgium has
been carried on to such an extent that
they are methodically taking away all the
machinery from the factories, which they
themselves have made idle, in some cases
to set it up again in Germany, in other
cases, to break it up and use it for grapeshot.</p>

<p>The purpose of this entire system of
destruction is double: First, to supply deficiencies
in German industry; secondly,
to put an end to Belgian competition and
later to subject Belgian industry to
that of Germany when the time comes
for refitting the factories with machinery
after the war.</p>

<p>The proofs collected by the Belgian Government
in support of this statement are
conclusive. It is significant that in general
the task of systematically stripping
Belgian factories was intrusted to German
manufacturers who were the direct
competitors of the Belgian owners. Some
of them have taken advantage of their
official positions to steal secrets of
manufacturing processes, for example, at
the artificial silk shops of Obourg, and
personal methods of production and sale.</p>

<p>And as to the fact that Germany is destroying
the factories for a military reason
without any regard for the economic
needs of Belgium or for the rights of nations,
it is sufficient to cite the following
passages from a semi-official note that
appeared in the Norddeutsche Allgemeine
Zeitung, No. 392, of Dec. 18, 1917, in which
Germany distinctly pleads guilty:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"All measures taken in Belgium are
inspired by military necessity.</p>

<p>The exploitation, under military control,
of Belgian factories in order to repair
locomotives and automobiles, and
also to obtain material of war for the
front, is carried out for the purpose of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_523" title="pg 523"> </a>
relieving the strain on German industry
and economizing transportation. It
has become necessary to strip the Belgian
factories of their machinery and
other fittings, because all German industry
is busy filling orders for material
of war. * * * By relieving the
home market from the necessity of enlarging
our own factories we are accelerating
the production of munitions
and other products. * * * In consequence
of the intense activity of all German
industry our machinery and other
equipment is tremendously overworked,
and must from time to time be partly
replaced by new machines, while, furthermore,
we must be able to furnish
spare parts rapidly unless we wish to
see our output of munitions diminish.
The machinery and equipment required
for these purposes are evidently brought
from Belgian factories. The destruction
of whole factories for the production of
grapeshot is effected in order to maintain
at its present level the supply of
iron and steel in Germany, or, if possible,
to raise it. * * * It is not only
possible, but even evident, that, in view
of all the steps taken by the military
authorities, the question of keeping up
work in some of the factories of the occupied
country must be subordinated to
considerations tending to spare the lives
of German soldiers and thus protect our
national power."</p>

<p>This record of the deliberate crippling
of Belgian industries was brought up to
March 6, 1918, by an official dispatch
to the United States Government, quoting
the statement of Belgian refugees
to the effect that dynamite was being
used to destroy machines and equipment
in factories in the Mons district. Rails
of tramways were being taken up, and
in some cities they were entirely destroyed.
Meanwhile, deportation of men,
and even of children 13 years old, was
proceeding, several hundred boys between
the ages of 13 and 15 being taken
from Mons alone.</p>

<h2>Spoliation of Belgian Churches</h2>

<h3>Cardinal Mercier's Protest</h3>

<p class="drop">Cardinal Mercier, Archbishop
of Malines, issued the following letter
to the clergy and people of his
diocese on March 2, 1918:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>My Very Dear Brethren:</i></p>

<p>The painful tidings, announced semi-officially
on Feb. 8, by the occupying power,
have been confirmed. The bulletin of
laws and edicts, dated Feb. 21, requires
an inventory of the bells and organs of
our churches. Informed by experience,
we need not delude ourselves; the inventory
of today is the signal for the requisition
of tomorrow.</p>

<p>The repeated protests of the Sovereign
Pontiff, our appeal to the Chancellor of
the Empire, appear thus to have been in
vain.</p>

<p>Your Christian hearts will bleed. At a
time when we are in such need of comfort,
a veil of mourning will descend upon
our land, covering like a shroud our every
day. It is to be for Catholic Belgium an
interminable Way of the Cross.</p>

<p>It is true, is it not, dear brethren, that
we should have borne this sorrow, added
to so many others, if it had concerned
ourselves alone, but this time the rights
of God, of our Saviour, Jesus, the freedom
of the Church and of her heritage
are to be sacrificed to what is called necessity,
that is, to the military need of
our enemies.</p>

<p>"This term, liberty of the Church, rings
harshly on the ears of politicians," writes
the great Dom Gueranger. They immediately
discern therein the signs of a conspiracy.
Now there is no thought in our
minds either of conspiracy or of revolt,
but of the indefeasible affirmation of the
rights granted to His Immaculate Spouse
by our Saviour, Jesus.</p>

<p>The freedom of the Church lies in her
complete independence with regard to all
secular powers, not alone in her teachings
of the Word, in the administering of the
sacraments, in the untrammeled relations
between all ranks of her Divine hierarchy,
but also in the publishing and applying of
her disciplinary decrees&mdash;in the conservation
and administration of her temporal
heritage.</p>

<p>"Nothing in the world is dearer to God
than this liberty of His Church," says
St. Anselm.</p>

<p>The Apostolic See, through the medium
of Pope Pius VIII., wrote on June 30,
1830, to the Bishops of the Rhine Province:
"It is in virtue of a Divine order that
the Church, spotless spouse of the Immaculate
Lamb, Jesus Christ, is free
and subject to no earthly dominion."</p>

<p>"This freedom of the Church," continues
Dom Gueranger, "is the bulwark of the
very sanctuary, hence, the shepherd,
sentinel of Israel, should not wait until
the enemy has entered into the fold to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_524" title="pg 524"> </a>
sound the cry of alarm. The duty of
protecting his flock begins for him at
the moment of the enemy's siege of his
outposts, upon whose safety depends the
police of the entire city."</p>

<p>In the execution of this duty of our
pastoral office we protest, dear brethren,
against the injury which the forcible
seizure of church property will cause to
the liberty of our mother, the Holy
Church.</p>

<p>We add that the removal of the bells
without the consent of the religious authorities
and despite their protests will
be a sacrilege.</p>

<p>The bell is, in fact, a sacred object its
function is sacred. It is a consecrated
object; that is to say, it is devoted irrevocably
to Divine service. It has been not
only blessed but anointed by the Bishop
with the holy oil and the holy chrism,
just as you were anointed and consecrated
at holy baptism; just as anointed
and consecrated as the priest's hands
which are to touch the consecrated wafer.</p>

<p>The function of the bell is holy. The
bell is sanctified by the Holy Ghost, says
the liturgy, sanctificetur a Spiritu Sancto,
to the end that, in its voice, the faithful
shall recognize the voice of the Church
calling her children to hasten to her
breast.</p>

<p>It announced your initiation into Christian
life, your confirmation, your first
communion. It announced, dear parents,
your Christian marriage; it weeps for the
dead; thrice daily it marks the mystery
of the Incarnation; it recalls the immolation
of the Lamb of God on the altar of
sacrifice; it sings the joys of Sabbath
rest, the cheer of our festivals of Christmas,
of Easter, of Pentecost. Her prayers
are associated with all the events and all
the great memories, happy or unhappy, of
the fatherland.</p>

<p>Yes, the seizure of our bells will be a
profanation; whosoever assists in it will
lend the hand to a sacrilege.</p>

<p>The Catholic Bishops of Germany and
Austria will not deny these principles.
If their patriotism has wrung from them
concessions which must have cost their
religious spirit dear, patriotism with us
confirms on the contrary the law of resistance.
We would be betraying the
Church and the fatherland were we so cowardly
as to permit without a public act
of reprobation the taking away of metal
to be converted by the enemy into engines
of destruction, destined to carry death
into the ranks of the heroes who are sacrificing
themselves for us.</p>

<p>The authorities, strangers to our beliefs,
will not be greatly moved, I fear,
by the protest, however worthy of respect,
of our religious consciences, but at
least they should remember their given
word and not tear up a juridical code
which their believers have elaborated with
us and promulgated. Morality has force
of law for Governments as for individuals.</p>

<p>On Oct. 18, 1907, the representatives of
forty-four Governments gathered together
at The Hague, drew up a convention concerning
laws and customs of war on land.</p>

<p>They were assembled, they proclaimed
unanimously, for a double purpose&mdash;in the
first place to safeguard peace and prevent
armed conflicts between nations; and, in
the second place, in the extreme hypothesis
of an appeal to arms, to serve, nevertheless,
the interests of humanity and the
progressive demands of civilization by
restraining, as much as possible, the
rigors of war.</p>

<p>To this convention there was annexed a
set of regulations which, the general tenor
of its clauses having been examined a first
and a second time, respectively, during
the peace conferences held in 1874 at Brussels
and in 1899 at The Hague, was submitted
a third time, in 1907, to careful
study at the second conference at The
Hague and signed by the plenipotentiaries
of all the great powers.</p>

<p>The first signer of this code of international
law in wartime was Baron Marschall
von Bieberstein, delegated by his
Majesty, the German Emperor, King of
Prussia.</p>

<p>Articles 52 and 46 of the regulations annexed
to the convention are formulated as
follows:</p>

<p>"Article 52. Neither requisitions in kind
nor service can be demanded from communes
or inhabitants, except for the
necessities of the army of occupation."</p>

<p>"Article 46. Family honor and rights,
individual life and private property, as
well as religious convictions and worship,
must be respected."</p>

<p>Evidently bells and organs are not necessary
to supply the needs of the army of
occupation, they lie in the domain of
private property, are destined for the
exercise of Catholic worship.</p>

<p>The transformation of these articles of
the Church into war munitions will be,
therefore, a flagrant violation of international
law, an act of force perpetrated
on the weaker by the stronger because he
is the stronger.</p>

<p>We Belgians, who have never wished
nor acted other than well toward Germany,
we are the weak ones. I call you
all to witness, brethren, is it not true that
prior to 1914 a current of sympathy, of
esteem, of generous hospitality was turning
our trusting hearts toward those who
are today so harshly oppressing us? You
will remember that on the very day of the
invasion the first lines that flowed from
my pen spoke to you of those "whom we
have the sorrow to call our enemies." For
four years Germany has been rewarding
us. Nevertheless, we will not rebel. You
will not seek in desperate recourse to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_525" title="pg 525"> </a>
material force the sudden triumph of our
rights.</p>

<p>Courage does not reside in passionate
impulse but in self-mastery. We will offer
to God in reparation for the sacrilege
which is about to be committed against
Him, and for the final success of our
cause, our supreme sacrifice.</p>

<p>Let us pray, one for the other, that the
arm of the All-Powerful may lend us support;
"Lord," says the Holy Spirit, in the
Book of Esther, "Lord, Sovereign Master,
all is subject to Thy authority.
Nothing, nobody, is capable of resisting
Thee if Thou shalt decide to save Israel.
* * * Grant our prayer, Lord!
Transform our grief into joy, so that,
living, we may glorify Thy name.
* * * Thou art just, Lord. Now they
are no longer satisfied to weigh us down
under the most grievous servitude, they
intend to silence the voices that praise
Thee and to tarnish the glory of the
temple. Remember us, O Lord. Reveal
Thyself to us in this hour of our tribulation.
* * * O God, Thou art exalted
above all, hearken to the voice of those
who place their hopes in Thee. Deliver
us from the blows of injustice and grant
that our courage may control our fears."</p>

<p>In the name of the freedom of the
Church, in the name of the sanctity of the
Catholic religion, in the name of international
law, we condemn and reprove the
seizure of the bells and organs of our
churches; we forbid the clergy and faithful
of our diocese to co-operate toward
their removal; we refuse to accept the
price of the sacred objects taken from us
by violence.</p>

<p>Strong in invincible hope, we await the
hour of our God.</p>

<h2>Belgium's Appeal to the Bolsheviki</h2>

<p><i>The Belgian Government, shortly after
the Bolshevist Government of Russia deserted
the Allies and disbanded its
armies, sent this eloquent appeal to
Petrograd:</i></p>

<p class="drop">By the treaty of April 19, 1839, Russia
placed her guarantee upon the
independence and neutrality of Belgium.
On Aug. 4, 1914, when Germany
had violated this neutrality&mdash;which the
German Government also had guaranteed&mdash;Belgium
appealed to Russia for aid.
To this appeal Russia replied on Aug. 5
by promising the assistance of her arms.
Thus Belgium entered into the struggle
for independence and neutrality, trusting
in the unswerving loyalty of the Russian
people.</p>

<p>On Feb. 14, 1916, Russia undertook to
renew by a solemn act the pledges she
had made regarding Belgium, "heroically
faithful to her international obligations."
Russia declared before a listening world
that she would not cease hostilities until
Belgium should be re-established in her
independence and liberally indemnified
for the losses she had endured. Furthermore,
Russia promised her aid in assuring
the commercial and financial rehabilitation
of Belgium.</p>

<p>The authorities placed in power by the
Russian revolution have just signed&mdash;on
Feb. 9 and March 3, 1918&mdash;treaties under
which they lay down their arms before
the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires.</p>

<p>Yet Belgium is still the prey of
the imperial armies, which oppress her,
decimating her population by privations
and pitiless repressions, and overwhelming
her with the worst kind of moral
tortures. To these violences the Belgian
Nation continues to oppose forces of resistance
drawn from a consciousness of
right, from the beauty of her cause, from
her love of liberty.</p>

<p>Respect for treaties is the basis of the
moral and juridical relations of States
and the condition of an honest and regular
international order. Carried into
the war by a will to compel respect for
a treaty which Russia had guaranteed,
Belgium is pursuing the struggle without
wavering, and at the price of the
most cruel sacrifices. She considers that
the promise of Russia, in which she
trusted, is still binding. She refuses to
believe that the Russian people, master
of its destinies, will irrevocably abandon
the promises made in its name. Confident
in the honor and loyalty of the
Russian people, Belgium reserves to herself
the right to implore the execution
of obligations whose permanent character
places them outside any internal
changes of r&eacute;gime in the State.

<h2>Serbia's Hopes and Russia's Defection</h2>

<h3>By Nikola Pashitch</h3>

<p class="center small"><i>Premier and Foreign Minister of Serbia</i></p>

<p class="center small">[Speech delivered March 31, 1918, before the Skupshtina at Corfu and especially translated for
<span class="smcap">Current History Magazine</span>]</p>

<p class="drop">Since the last meeting of this Assembly
a great number of events
have come to pass which have
measurably modified the general
military and political situation. One of
our greatest allies, Russia, has retired
from the battlefield, but another ally,
quite as powerful as Russia, but doubtless
not yet bringing to bear all the
force of which she is capable, has rushed
to our aid.</p>

<p>These two principal events, with others
of less importance, have perceptibly
changed the situation which existed more
than a year ago, when Germany proposed
to us the conclusion of a peace "honorable"
for both the belligerent groups.
Already at that time had Germany perceived
the impossibility of fighting her
adversaries by military force alone, and
was obliged to resort to other means,
which she had already employed, although
in a more restrained fashion. So
Germany decided to make more energetic
use of her hidden channels with the idea
of disorganizing in the quickest possible
time the unity of her adversaries. She
contrived intrigues, employing different
methods according to the country where
they were to be used and where she believed
they would succeed.</p>

<p>You still remember the case of Miassoyedov,
which was perpetrated with the
aim of annihilating an entire Russian
army. You also remember the attempt
of the enemy to have Ireland revolt, an
experiment which dismally failed owing
to the prompt and energetic measures
taken by the British Government. Surely
you have a vivid memory of the criminal
exploitation which the enemy Governments
made in Italy of the Papal note
in favor of peace. Also, you remember
the numerous cases of arson of munition
plants by the action of their agents, and
the enemy propaganda of a premature
peace for the benefit of Germany, employed
to the limit by pacifists and certain
imperialist and international adventurers
through lectures and "defeatist"
newspapers in neutral countries.</p>

<h3>RUSSIA ALONE DECEIVED</h3>

<p>All these intrigues were clothed in
fine phrases and put forward with high
humanitarian ideals, by which the enemy
propagated monarchistic ideas in republics
and republican ideas in monarchies,
eulogizing a military r&eacute;gime in democratic
countries and in autocracies democratic,
republican, and even anarchistic
ideals.</p>

<p>They all had one sole end&mdash;to provoke
internal disorders and discord among the
Allies in order to divert the attention of
Germany's adversaries from the principal
aim. In every allied country these
secret machinations of our enemies were
unmasked and repelled. Repelled&mdash;except
in Russia. All these intrigues and
secret machinations could not succeed
anywhere except in Russia, where there
are many Germans, and where our enemies
managed to concentrate the entire
attention of a people in the midst of war
upon their internal organization. In this
way the possibility was placed in the
hands of enemies&mdash;most dangerous to the
liberty of the people and to their right
to dispose freely of their destiny&mdash;to
guide more easily the struggle with free
and democratic nations reared against
Prussianism in order to defend the rights
of the weak and prevent the enslaving of
other countries and other peoples.</p>

<h3>RUSSIAN LIBERTY DESTROYED</h3>

<p>The first revolutionary movement in
Russia was directed against an autocratic
and irresponsible Government. On
the side of the revolution they pretended
that the Government had initiated pourparlers
<a class="pagenum" id="page_527" title="pg 527"> </a>
for a separate peace with Germany
unknown to the Russian people and
the Allies. After this first movement, a
second took place in Russia demanding a
democratic peace "without annexations
and indemnities" on the basis of the
right of peoples to determine their destiny
freely and for themselves.</p>

<p>This second revolutionary provisional
Government not having the desire to
cut the bonds which attached Russia to
the democratic and allied countries, a
third movement followed, which did not
hesitate to cut the bonds uniting Russia
to the Allies, to demobilize the Russian
armies&mdash;an act contrary to all reason,
even revolutionary&mdash;and to initiate pourparlers
with the enemy at Brest-Litovsk
for a separate peace.</p>

<p>The result of these pourparlers was
the capitulation of the Maximalists to
Prussian militarism, the disguised annexation
by Germany of the great Baltic
provinces of Russia, and the conclusion
of peace between the Central Powers and
the Ukraine, by which the latter separated
from her enfeebled sister in order
consciously to aid the enemies of the Slav
race. The recognition of the independence
of Finland, Caucasia, and Poland
by the Central Powers followed, and,
upon its heels, disintegration and general
discord in Russia finally giving place to
the present civil and fratricidal war.</p>

<p>We would not wish to deny that the
Russian revolution counted for something
in the ranks of its sincere combatants in
the way of high social ideals, for democratic
reforms, and for liberty. But,
judging from its results, it is impossible
to deny that the Russian revolution sustained
a German influence, and that this
influence so far has been useful only to
Germany, who still makes war on Russia
in order to prevent the latter from unifying
her enfeebled peoples and re-establishing
her position in the world.</p>

<h3>A SHAMEFUL CATASTROPHE</h3>

<p>The Russian revolutionists fell before
the blow of Prussian militarism and surrendered
to it the peoples who had hoped
to obtain the right of self-determination.
It is possible, even probable, that the
situation in Russia may improve. But
at present what the Germans aimed at in
Russia has been attained. They have
taken away Russian provinces, incited
civil war in the Russian fatherland, and
removed the danger of the Russian
armies which threatened them. These
armies having been prematurely demobilized
for incomprehensible reasons, the
enemy is able to direct all his forces
against his other adversaries. He has
also obtained in this way a considerable
amount of war material and food.</p>

<p>This catastrophe, which has covered
the Russian people with shame, has been
a lesson to all other nations, for it has
definitely confirmed the conviction that
it was certainly Germany who provoked
this terrible war with the aim of conquest
and hegemony.</p>

<p>But the great and free America did not
wait for this moment before deciding to
declare war on Germany, who had placed
above the principles of right and justice
that of brute force. On account of the
Germans' conduct in the war, which surpassed
all known horror and barbarism,
not sparing even neutral nations, the
United States became convinced that it
was its duty to restrain this bestial
force if the world were not to fall under
the yoke of Prussian militarism. America
entered the war to defend civilization
and the right of people to dispose of
themselves.</p>

<h3>AMERICANS TO THE BREACH</h3>

<p>The appearance of North America on
the war stage filled the place made vacant
by the surrender of Russia. Our
allies having come to the conviction that
they could count no longer on Russia,
and that it would even be dangerous to
regard her as a military asset, have employed
all their forces in conformity with
the new situation in order to fortify the
solidarity which unites them and to augment
their military and material force
in proportion to what they had lost by
the withdrawal of Russia, all with the
idea of assuring the world a just and
durable peace based on the liberty of the
people to be self-determining. The
strength of the army of our allies is
greater by far than that of the enemy,
not only in man power but also in material.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_528" title="pg 528"> </a>
Organization is improving, and on
all questions there is complete accord.
Quite recently German war atrocities decided
Japan to participate still more actively
in the struggle.</p>

<p>The Serbian people, who have made
the greatest sacrifice and given the finest
proofs of their loyalty and fidelity
toward the Allies, may therefore be certain
that their sacrifices have not been
in vain, and that their ideals will be realized
if they continue to give in the
future the evidence of their military and
civil virtues, and if, as in the past, they
abhor all intrigues having for their aim
the destruction of our concord and union
in defense of the interests of our people,
who bear three names, but who form but
one nation. We have observed that Austria-Hungary,
particularly in these latter
days, has intensified her intrigues and
her calumnies against the Serbian people.
She began by spreading in Western
Europe the false rumor that Serbia had
tried, in an indirect way, to initiate pourparlers
for a separate peace, because in
our country and on the front of the Serbian
Army she had suggested that she
would be disposed to end the war against
Serbia were it not for the fact that King
Peter and the Serbian Government were
opposed to the project. All such intrigues
and calumnies, have only one
end&mdash;to destroy
the faith which our allies have in
the Serbian people, to rupture the national
concord, and by our discord and
quarrels to assure the conquest of the
Serbian Nation.</p>

<h3>SERBIA STILL FAITHFUL</h3>

<p>But our people know Austria-Hungary
too well to be taken in by these infamous
intrigues and to believe her lying
words. The nation remains faithful to
her noble allies, who are pouring out
their blood for little and weak nations,
and will not deviate one hair's breadth
from her stand until the end. The Serbian
people have given all that they
have, and now, although few in numbers,
they still stand faithfully by the side of
the Allies. They should never lose sight
of the fact that it was Austria-Hungary
who provoked the war with the idea of
annihilating Serbia.</p>

<p>Our allies will not fail to acquire the
conviction that the various peoples of
Austria-Hungary cannot be free, and
that a durable peace cannot be guaranteed
so long as these peoples shall live in
the State of the Hapsburgs, who from
peoples once free have made Germano-Magyar
slaves and have prevented their
development by subjecting them to Germano-Magyar
exploitation.</p>

<p>Germanism in its drive toward the
Orient hurled itself upon Serbia, and
only as a single united nation of Serbs,
Croats, and Slovenes, closely bound to
Italy, can we obstruct the German push
toward the Orient and Adriatic, and aid
in the establishment of a durable peace.</p>

<p>We ask only justice. We demand that
slavery of peoples be abolished, just as
slavery of individuals was suppressed.
We demand equality among all nations,
whether great or small, the fraternity
and equality of all nationalities, and the
foundation of a free State of all the reunited
Jugoslavs. The return of Alsace-Lorraine
to France and the complete re-establishment
of independent Belgium;
the re-establishment of the kingdom of
all the Czechs, also that of all the Poles,
the union of Italians with Italy, of Rumanians
with Rumania, of Greeks with
Greece, all of which would constitute the
greatest and most solid guarantee for a
just and lasting international peace.
Hence we proclaim what should be
realized soon or later&mdash;if not after this
war then after a new shedding of blood&mdash;because
this realization is identified with
the progress of civilization and of humanity.</p>

<p>These great ends, humane and just,
which are incarnated with the life and
growth of civilization, we repeat, should
be realized. They embrace those great
ideals which spring from the soul and
sentiments of individuals and races, and
which will vanquish the brute force of
certain anachronistic States, just as, in
the last century, they vanquished the
brute force of the individual.</p>

<p>Let us pledge our honor and eternal
gratitude to all the peoples who are
fighting for the right of all nations to
shape their own destiny and for an international
peace both just and lasting.

<h2>Rumania's Peace Treaty</h2>

<h3>Why the Onerous Terms of the Central Powers Had
to be Accepted</h3>

<p class="drop">The peace treaty between Rumania
and the Central Powers was
signed at Bucharest May 6, 1918,
and is called "the peace of Bucharest."
Dr. von K&uuml;hlmann, the German
Foreign Secretary, was Chairman
of the plenipotentiaries representing the
Central Powers. A comprehensive synopsis
of the terms of the treaty appears
elsewhere in this issue of <span class="smcap">Current History
Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>A writer in The London Times explains
why Rumania was compelled to
accept the enemy's exacting terms. He
quotes General Averescu, the Rumanian
Prime Minister, in these words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Rumania accepts the humiliating German
peace terms and is ready to yield to
her enemies the dearest part of her territory,
she does not do it only to spare
the lives of the remnants of her army, but
for the sake of her allies, too. If Rumania
refuses the German conditions today
she may be able to resist another
month, but the results will be fatal. A
month later she might have to lose even
the shadow of independence which is left
to her now; and then, no doubt, the Germans
would deal with her in the same
way as they dealt with occupied France
and with Belgium. The whole Rumanian
army would be made prisoners, and would
be sent to work on the western front
against the Allies, while the civilian population
would be compelled to work in ammunition
and other factories for the
Kaiser's army. I fought in the ranks in
1877 to help my country to win the Dobrudja.
You may imagine how I feel
now, having to sign the treaty which gives
it to our worst enemies. But we are compelled
to amputate an important part of
our body in order to save the rest of it.
However painful it may be, we are bound
to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>DESERTED BY RUSSIA</h3>

<p>To understand Rumania's situation, as
The London Times correspondent goes
on to say, we have to consider her position
since Kerensky's fall. At the end
of November, 1917, the front from the
Bukowina to the Black Sea was held by
a Russo-Rumanian force. Its flanks
from Dorna-Watra to Tergu-Ocna and
from Ivesti to the Black Sea were held
by three Russian armies, numbering
about 450,000 men, and by two Rumanian
armies of about 180,000 men. The Russian
armies were, of course, weakened
by many desertions and by lack of discipline,
so that their actual was much
less than their nominal strength. Nevertheless,
about 350,000 Russians were still
holding the front at that time. When
the Russian armistice was signed, Rumania
was compelled, by the joint threats
of Germany and the Soviets of the Rumanian
front, to adhere to it. From
that day the Russian troops began to
leave the trenches, not in hundreds, as
they did before, but in masses of thousands
at a time. Thus, at the end of
January, 1918, hardly 50,000 Russians remained
on the whole Rumanian front,
and they had no desire to fight the enemy,
but, being from Siberia or some other remote
part of Russia, found it more convenient
to spend their time in Rumania
than to go back to their own country.
They could easily raise money by selling
to the highest bidder (Austrian or Rumanian)
their guns, rifles, motor cars, &amp;c.</p>

<p>For a certain time many&mdash;especially
the French&mdash;believed strongly in the
Ukraine and in the promises of the Rada.
Much money had been spent in recruiting
an army of the Ukraine which was
supposed to fill the gaps left by the Russian
Army on the southwestern front.
All that I saw of this army was a group
of about 150 boys, none of them over the
age of 16, armed with rifles with fixed
bayonets, a pistol, a sword, and a dagger.
All wore spurs, though none of them had
a horse. They paraded in the main
streets of Jassy daily between 11 and
12. I calculated that every one of these
boys cost the Entente well over &pound;10,000.
But in time the most incorrigible dreamers
realized that the Ukraine had played
a trick on Rumania. Then the handsome
<a class="pagenum" id="page_530" title="pg 530"> </a>
Ukrainian toy soldiers were withdrawn
from circulation, and no army ever replaced
the Russians.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Rumanian Government
decided, for political and military
reasons, to occupy Bessarabia. This
operation required no less than seven
divisions. Thus at the beginning of
February the same front which was held
in November by over 500,000 men was
occupied by barely 120,000. Army supplies
were getting shorter every day; and
Rumania, being in a state of war with
the Bolshevist Government, was completely
cut off from the rest of her allies.
In these circumstances Germany had an
easy prey, and dealt with it in true German
fashion.</p>

<h3>AN IMPERIOUS SUMMONS</h3>

<p>When the treaty with the Ukraine was
signed Rumanian Headquarters received
a note from General Morgen, the German
Commander in Chief, saying that, as
peace with Russia had been concluded,
the Rumanian armistice had come to an
end, and that delegates should be sent
without delay to Focsani to examine the
new situation. The Rumanian delegates
arrived at Focsani next day. They were
received with such insolence by the German
delegates that the Chief of the Rumanian
General Staff, General Lupesco,
threatened to leave immediately. The
discussions, however, did not last very
long, and the mission came back with the
announcement that Rumania had to decide
within four days whether she was
ready to discuss peace terms or not. A
Crown Council was held immediately;
and the majority of the Generals declared
that the army could resist for a month
at the most. M. Bratiano and M. Take
Jonescu, who could not consent to make
peace with the enemy, resigned, and the
King asked General Averescu, the most
popular man in Rumania, to form a new
Cabinet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, King Ferdinand received a
telegram from Berlin, by which he was
warned that the Austro-German Government
would not discuss peace terms with
a Cabinet which included M. Bratiano or
any member of his former Cabinet. The
feelings of the King of Rumania&mdash;when
he saw that even before peace discussions
had begun the enemy had begun to interfere
in Rumania's internal politics&mdash;-can
be appreciated. But King Ferdinand
carried his head high, as he had done all
through the tragic misfortunes of his
country, and was indifferent to German
arrogance. He replied to Herr von K&uuml;hlmann
that Rumania was an independent
country, and had a right to any Government
she pleased. But none of the members
of the former Cabinet came into the
new one. General Averescu formed a Government
which had the tragic task of concluding
peace, and thus of annihilating,
temporarily at least, all the tremendous
efforts that Rumania had made during
the preceding fifty years to become, economically
as well as politically, the leading
power in the Balkans.</p>

<h3>THREE HUNGRY ENEMIES</h3>

<p>The peace negotiations were supposed
to last for a fortnight at most. In fact,
they were nothing more than a farce, for
the Germans allowed no discussion at
all. They simply laid their preliminary
conditions before the Rumanian delegates,
and, taking advantage of the military
helplessness of Rumania, told them:
"You can take it or can leave it." The
Rumanian delegates made a few attempts
to discuss the German terms, but they
soon found that it was useless and that
the only thing to do was to yield.</p>

<p>The fact was that Rumania had to satisfy
three hungry enemies. Each had
his own object, but in each case the result
was the same from the point of view
of Rumania&mdash;subjection to the German
yoke. The Bulgarians were eager to accomplish
their ideal of "a great Bulgaria"
by the annexation of the Dobrudja.
Therefore, Rumania had to give
up the Dobrudja. The Austrians, under
Magyar pressure, demanded the surrender
of the Carpathian passes&mdash;a condition
which was pressed by Count Czernin,
who remembered with bitterness the rebuff
that he had suffered from the Rumanian
King and Government at the time
when Rumania came into the war. The
Germans were determined to seize the immensely
rich oilfields of Rumania and to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_531" title="pg 531"> </a>
secure for an unlimited period Rumanian
wheat for Germany at a price to be fixed
by German authorities. For years Germany
had tried to get control of the Rumanian
oilfields. Where bribes and the
offer of a heavy price had failed, the
chance of war now insured success. The
oilfields were seized nominally by way of
a monopoly for ninety-nine years.</p>

<h3>GERMANY'S SHARE OF BOOTY</h3>

<p>As usual, Germany's allies had to yield
up some of the prey to her. Thus the
Germans succeeded in setting up a condominium
over the most important part
of the Dobrudja, between Constanza and
the mouths of the Danube. From Campina,
the centre of the oilfields district,
a pipe line runs direct to Constanza,
where the oil can be stored in enormous
tanks, which were left practically untouched
when Constanza was abandoned
in November, 1916. It is essential for
Germany that she should control the pipe
line, and this she will certainly do under
the form of the condominium.</p>

<p>As for the grain supply, the Germans,
who had had to pay a heavy price for
Rumanian grain before Rumania went to
war, owing especially to British competition,
were particularly careful to insure
now against the repetition of anything so
unpleasant. The form of the agreement
which was dictated to Rumania on this
point is that the surplus is to go to Germany
after the needs of Rumania have
been satisfied. What the needs of Rumania
may be will be decided by a Rumanian
commission; but this is to be under
German control, and there is not
much doubt that the ration allowed to
the Rumanian population will be proportioned
pretty accurately to the needs of
Germany.</p>

<p>These territorial and economic advantages
secured, Germany went on to add
humiliation for Rumania to the heavy
toll of material loss. They insisted that
the eight Rumanian divisions which were
holding the Rumanian front should be
demobilized at once under the control of
German staff officers. Finally, the Germans
asked that the Rumanian Government
should give all possible facilities to
a German force to pass through Rumania
to Odessa. In point of fact, on March
10, long before the peace conditions were
settled, the first German battalions
passed through Galatz on their way to
the Ukraine.</p>

<p>All these humiliating conditions had to
be accepted. The motive of the Germans
in piling up their enactions so frequently
was evidently to compel the Averescu
Cabinet, which they suspected of being
pro-ally, to resign. They hoped to force
the King to form a Cabinet of their
Bucharest friends. In this they succeeded.
The present Government of Rumania may
be pro-German; but the Rumanian Nation&mdash;from
the last peasant soldier, who
brought the Germans to a stand last
Summer at Maraseshti and Oitoz, to the
King&mdash;bitterly hates everything German.
Isolated as Rumania is now, she waits
breathlessly for the victory of the Allies,
hoping to be helped to free herself from
German dominion.</p>

<h2>The Peace of Bucharest</h2>

<h3>Synopsis of Rumania's Peace Treaty</h3>

<p class="drop">Following is a comprehensive summary
of the treaty finally signed by
the Rumanian Government at Bucharest,
May 6, 1918:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hang"><span class="olde">Clause 1.</span>&mdash;<i>Re-establishment of Peace
and Friendship.</i></p>

<p>Article I. Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria,
and Turkey, on the one hand, and Rumania
on the other, declare the state of war
ended and that the contracting parties are
determined henceforth to live together in
peace and friendship.</p>

<p>Article II. Diplomatic and Consular relations
between the contracting parties will be
resumed immediately after the ratification of
the peace treaty. The admission of Consuls
will be reserved for a future agreement.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="olde">Clause 2.</span>&mdash;<i>Demobilization of the Rumanian
Forces.</i></p>

<p>Article III. The demobilization of the Rumanian
<a class="pagenum" id="page_532" title="pg 532"> </a>
Army, which is now proceeding, will
immediately after peace is signed be carried
out according to the prescriptions contained
in Articles IV. and VII.</p>

<p>Article IV. The regular military bureau, the
supreme military authorities and all the military
institutions will remain in existence as
provided by the last peace budget. The demobilization
of divisions eleven to fifteen will
be continued as stipulated in the treaty of
Focsani signed on March 8 last. Of the Rumanian
divisions one to ten, the two infantry
divisions now employed in Bessarabia, including
the J&auml;ger battalions which are the
remnants of dissolved J&auml;ger divisions, and
including two cavalry divisions of the Rumanian
Army, will remain on a war footing
until the danger arising from the military
operations now being carried on in the
Ukraine by the Central Powers ceases to
exist.</p>

<p>The remaining eight divisions, including the
staff, shall be maintained in Moldavia at the
reduced peace strength. Each division will
be composed of four infantry regiments, two
cavalry regiments, two field artillery regiments,
and one battalion of pioneers, together
with the necessary technical and transport
troops. The total number of the infantry of
the eight divisions shall not exceed 20,000
men; the total number of cavalry shall not
exceed 3,200; the entire artillery of the Rumanian
Army, apart from the mobile divisions,
shall not exceed 9,000 men. The
divisions remaining mobilized in Bessarabia
must, in case of demobilization, be reduced
to the same peace standard as the eight
divisions mentioned in Article 4.</p>

<p>All other Rumanian troops which did
not exist in peace time will at the end of
their term of active military service remain
as in peace time. Reservists shall not be
called up for training until a general peace
has been concluded.</p>

<p>Article V. Guns, machine guns, small arms,
horses, and cars and ammunition, which are
available owing to the reduction or the dissolution
of the Rumanian units, shall be
given into the custody of the Supreme Command
of the allied (Teutonic) forces in
Rumania until the conclusion of a general
peace. They shall be guarded and superintended
by Rumanian troops under supervision
of the allied command. The amount of ammunition
to be left to the Rumanian Army
in Moldavia is 250 rounds for each rifle, 2,500
for each machine gun, and 150 for each gun.
The Rumanian Army is entitled to exchange
unserviceable material at the depots of the
occupied region, in agreement with the allied
Supreme Command, and to demand from the
depots the equivalent of the ammunition
spent. The divisions in Rumania which remain
mobilized will receive their ammunition
requirements on a war basis.</p>

<p>Article VI. The demobilized Rumanian
troops to remain in Moldavia until the evacuation
of the occupied Rumanian regions.
Excepted from this provision are military
bureaus and men mentioned in Article 5,
who are required for the supervision of the
arms and material laid down in these regions.
The men and reserve officers who have been
demobilized can return to the occupied regions.
Active and formerly active officers require,
in order to return to these regions, permission
of the chief army command of the
allied forces.</p>

<p>Article VII. A General Staff officer of the
allied powers, with staff, will be attached to
the Rumanian Commander in Chief in Moldavia,
and a Rumanian General Staff officer,
with staff, will be attached as liaison officer
to the chief command of the allied forces in
the occupied Rumanian districts.</p>

<p>Article VIII. The Rumanian naval forces
will be left to their full complement and
equipment, in so far as their views, in accordance
with Article IX., are not to be limited
until affairs in Bessarabia are cleared,
whereupon these forces are to be brought to
the usual peace standard. Excepted herefrom
are river forces required for the purposes of
river police and naval forces on the Black
Sea, employed for the protection of maritime
traffic and the restoration of mine-free fairways.
Immediately after the signing of the
peace treaty these river forces will, on a
basis of special arrangement, be placed at
the disposal of the authorities intrusted with
river policing. The Nautical Black Sea Commission
will receive the right of disposing of
the naval forces on the Black Sea, and a
naval officer is to be attached to this commission
in order to restore connection therewith.</p>

<p>Article IX. All men serving in the army
and navy, who in peace time were employed
in connection with harbors or shipping, shall,
on demobilization, be the first to be dismissed
in order that they may find employment
in their former occupations.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="olde">Clause 3.</span>&mdash;<i>Cessions of territory outlined
in Articles X., XI.,
and XII.</i></p>

<p>Article X. With regard to Dobrudja, which,
according to Paragraph 1 of the peace preliminaries,
is to be added by Rumania, the
following stipulations are laid down: (A)
Rumania cedes again to Bulgaria, with
frontier rectifications, Bulgarian territory
that fell to her by virtue of the peace treaty
concluded at Bucharest in 1913. (Attached is
a map showing the exact extent of the
frontier rectification, with a note to the
effect that it forms an essential part of the
peace treaty.) A commission composed of
representatives of the allied powers shall
shortly after the signature of the treaty lay
down and demarkate on the spot the new
frontier line in Dobrudja. The Danube
frontier between the regions ceded to Bulgaria
and Rumania follows the river valley.
Directly after the signature of the treaty
further particulars shall be decided upon
regarding the definition of the valley. Thus
<a class="pagenum" id="page_533" title="pg 533"> </a>
the demarkation shall take place in Autumn,
1918, at low water level.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(B) Rumania cedes to the allied powers
that portion of Dobrudja up to the Danube
north of the new frontier line described
under Section A; that is to say, between the
confluence of the stream and the Black Sea,
to the St. George branch of the river. The
Danube frontier between the territory ceded
to the allied powers and Rumania will be
formed by the river valley. The allied powers
and Rumania will undertake to see that
Rumania shall receive an assured trade route
to the Black Sea, by way of Tchernavoda and
Constanza, (Kustendje.)</p>

<p>Article XI. says that Rumania agrees that
her frontier shall undergo rectification in
favor of Austria-Hungary as indicated on
the map, and continues:</p>

<p>"Two mixed commissions, to be composed
of equal numbers of representatives of the
powers concerned, are immediately after the
ratification of the peace treaty to fix a new
frontier line on the spot."</p>

<p>Article XII. Property in the ceded regions
of Rumania passes without indemnification
to the States which acquire these regions.
Those States to which the ceded territories
fall shall make agreements with Rumania on
the following points: First, with regard to
the allegiance of the Rumanian inhabitants
of these regions and the manner in which
they are to be accorded the right of option;
secondly, with regard to the property of communes
split by the new frontier; thirdly and
fourthly, with regard to administrative and
juridical matters; fifthly, with regard to the
effect of the changes of territory on dioceses.</p>

<p>Clause 4 deals with war indemnities, of
which Article XIII. declares that the contracting
parties mutually renounce indemnification
<a class="pagenum" id="page_534" title="pg 534"> </a>
of their war costs, and special arrangements
are to be made for the settlement
of damages caused by the war.</p>

<p>The fifth clause relates to the evacuation
of occupied territories, embodied in Articles
XIV. to XXIV., summed up as follows:</p>

<p>"The occupied Rumanian territories shall
be evacuated at times to be later agreed
upon. The strength of the army of occupation
shall, apart from the formation employed
in economic functions, not surpass six
divisions. Until the ratification of the treaty
the present occupation administration continues,
but immediately after the signature
of the treaty the Rumanian Government has
the power to supplement the corps of officials
by such appointments or dismissals as
may seem good to it."</p>

<p>Up to the time of evacuation, a civil official
of the occupation administration shall
always be attached to the Rumanian Ministry
in order to facilitate so far as possible the
transfer of the civil administration to the
Rumanian authorities. The Rumanian authorities
must follow the directions which the
commanders of the army of occupation consider
requisite in the interest of the security
of the occupied territory, as well as the security,
maintenance, and distribution of their
troops.</p>

<p>For the present, railways, posts, and telegraphs
will remain under military administration,
and will, in accordance with proper
agreements, be at the disposal of the authorities
and population. As a general rule, the
Rumanian courts will resume jurisdiction in
the occupied territories to their full extent.
The allied powers will retain jurisdiction, as
well as the power of police supervision, over
those belonging to the army of occupation.
Punishable acts against the army of occupation
will be judged by its military tribunals,
and also offenses against the orders of the
occupation administration. Persons can only
return to the occupied territories in proportion
as the Rumanian Government provides
for their security and maintenance.</p>

<p>The army of occupation's right to requisition
is restricted to wheat, peas, beans, fodder,
wool, cattle, and meat from the products
of 1918, and, further, to timber, oil and oil
products, always observing proper regard for
an orderly plan of procuring these commodities,
as well as satisfying the home needs of
Rumania.</p>

<p>From the ratification of the treaty onward
the army of occupation shall be maintained
at the expense of Rumania. A separate
agreement will be made with regard to the
details of the transfer of the civil administration,
as well as with regard to the withdrawal
of the regulations of the occupation
administration. Money spent by the allied
powers in the occupied territories on public
works, including industrial undertakings,
shall be made good on their transfer. Until
the evacuation these undertakings shall remain
under the military administration.</p>

<p><span class="olde">Clause 6.</span>&mdash;<i>Regulations regarding navigation
on the Danube.</i></p>

<p>Article XXIV. Rumania shall conclude a
new Danube Navigation act with Germany,
Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey, regulating
the legal position on the Danube
from the point where it becomes navigable,
with due regard for the prescriptions subsequently
set forth under Sections A to D, and
on conditions that the prescriptions under
Section B shall apply equally for all parties
to the Danube act. Negotiations regarding
the new Danube Navigation act shall begin
at Munich as soon as possible after the ratification
of the treaty.</p>

<p>The sections follow: (A) Under the name
Danube Mouth Commission, the European
Danube Commission shall, under conditions
subsequently set forth, be maintained as a
permanent institution, empowered with the
privileges and obligations hitherto appertaining
to it for the river from Braila downward,
inclusive of this port. The conditions referred
to provide, among other things, that
the commission shall henceforth only comprise
representatives of States situated on
the Danube or the European coasts of the
Black Sea. The commission's authority extends
from Braila downward to the whole of
the arms and mouth of the Danube and adjoining
parts of the Black Sea.</p>

<p>(B.) Rumania guarantees to the ships of
the other contracting parties free navigation
on the Rumanian Danube, including the harbors.
Rumania shall levy no toll on ships
or rafts of the contracting parties and their
cargoes merely for the navigation of the
river. Neither shall Rumania, in the future,
levy on the river any tolls, save those permitted
by the new Danube Navigation act.</p>

<p>Section C provides for the abolition after
the ratification of the treaty of the Rumanian
ad valorem duty of 1-1/2 per cent. on imports
and exports.</p>

<p>Articles XXV. and XXVI. deal with Danube
questions and provide that Germany, Austria-Hungary,
Bulgaria, Turkey, and Rumania
are entitled to maintain warships on the
Danube, which may navigate down stream to
the sea and up stream as far as the upper
frontier of Austria's territory, but are forbidden
intercourse with the shore of another
State or to put in there except under force
majeure or with the consent of the State.</p>

<p>The powers represented on the Danube
Mouth Commission are entitled to maintain
two light warships each as guard ships at
the mouth of the Danube.</p>

<p>Article XXVII. provides equal rights for
all religious denominations, including Jews
and Moslems, in Rumania, including the right
to establish private schools.</p>

<p>Article XXVIII. provides that diversity of
religion does not affect legal, political, or
civil rights of the inhabitants, and, pending
ratification of the treaty, a decree will be
<a class="pagenum" id="page_535" title="pg 535"> </a>
proclaimed giving the full rights of Rumanian
subjects to all those, such as Jews, having
no nationality.</p>

<p>The remaining three articles provide that
economic relations shall be regulated by
separate treaties, coming into operation at
the same time as the peace treaty. The same
applies to the exchange of prisoners.</p>

<h3>THE KAISER EXULTS</h3>

<p>Emperor William replied to Chancellor
von Hertling's congratulations on the
conclusion of peace between Germany
and Rumania with this message:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The termination of the state of war in
the east fills me also with proud joy and
gratitude. Thanks to God's gracious help,
the German people, with never-failing patriotism,
under brilliant military leadership
and with the assistance of strong
diplomacy, are fighting step by step for a
happy future.</p>

<p>I can but convey my thanks on this
occasion to you and also to your collaborators.
God will help us to pass through
the struggle which the hostile attitude of
the powers, still under arms against us,
has forced us to continue and to conclude
it victoriously for the good of Germany
and her allies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emperor William in a telegram to Dr.
Richard von K&uuml;hlmann, the German
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conclusion of peace with Rumania
gives me an opportunity of expressing my
joyful satisfaction that peace has now
been given to the entire eastern front.</p>

<p>May rich blessings descend on the peoples
concerned from the resumption of
peaceful labor to which they can now devote
themselves.</p>

<p>I thank you and your collaborators for
the work done in loyal co-operation with
our allies, and I confer on you as a sign
of my appreciation the Order of the Royal
Crown of the First Class.</p>

<h2>Bessarabia Voluntarily United to Rumania</h2>

<p>Count Czernin, the Austro-Hungarian
Foreign Minister, during the negotiations
with Rumania explained in a public
speech that Rumania would be compensated
for the loss of territory on the
Transylvanian border by taking the
southern part of Bessarabia, the Russian
province bordering Rumania on the east.
The southern part of Bessarabia, however,
has few Rumanians, while the
northern part is largely populated by
them. Subsequent events have apparently
changed the Austro-German plans, for
the whole of Bessarabia has voted almost
unanimously for union with Rumania.
The event was officially announced
at Washington on April 22
through the Rumanian Charge d'Affaires,
N. H. Lahovary, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On April 9 the National Assembly of
Bessarabia voted by 86 against 3 for union
of Bessarabia to Rumania. The Rumanian
Premier was then at Kishinev (capital
of Bessarabia) and took cognizance of the
vote amid enthusiastic acclamation and
declared this union to be definitive and
indissoluble.</p>

<p>Bessarabian delegates went to Jassy on
April 12 to present the homage of the people
of Bessarabia to their Majesties the
King and Queen of Rumania. A Te Deum
was sung at the cathedral in the presence
of the royal family, the Government, and
the Bessarabian delegates. The Archbishop
of Bessarabia was also there, having
taken the place next to the Metropolitan
of Moldavia, who celebrated the service.</p>

<p>After the ceremony was over a parade of
the troops took place, followed by a luncheon
given at the royal palace in honor of
the Ministers of Bessarabia. His Majesty
the King drank to the health of the united
Rumanian and Bessarabian people, after
witnessing the great historic event accomplished
by the will of the people of Bessarabia
and proclaiming indissoluble the
union of the ancient province of the Moldavian
crown to the mother country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bessarabia, according to Mr. Lahovary,
has about 3,000,000 inhabitants, and
more than three-fourths of these are Rumanians.
"Bessarabia," he continued,
"is one of the richest farm lands of what
was formerly Russia. The Bolsheviki
ravaged it frightfully during the Winter
months, and the country was only
saved by the Rumanian troops, who
were called in by the Bessarabians. Because
of this help the Bolsheviki declared
war on Rumania, and there were
violent clashes between the Bolshevist
brigands and Rumanian troops. Finally
the latter ousted the Bolsheviki and
succeeded in restoring tranquillity, but
only after the Bolsheviki had committed
most frightful outrages and pillaged
the country. If Rumania was obliged
to make peace, it was due directly to
the attitude of the Bolsheviki toward
Rumania."

<h2>The War and the Bagdad Railway</h2>

<h3>A Study by Dr. Morris Jastrow</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Professor of Semitic Languages in the University of Pennsylvania</i></p>

<p class="center">[From his book, "The War and the Bagdad Railway"]</p>

<p class="small"><i>Germany's project of a railway from Berlin to Bagdad, now rivaled by a new one from
Berlin to Bombay via Russia, was one of the chief causes of the war. It dates from 1888,
when a syndicate of German and British capital organized the Anatolian Railway, to be built
from Haidar Pacha, opposite Constantinople, to Angora&mdash;about 360 miles. The German members
later bought out the British interests. Further concessions were obtained, but in 1898 a
much more ambitious plan was brought forward by the visit of the German Emperor to Sultan
Abdul Hamid, and in 1899 the general policy of a line across Asia Minor was announced. This
line, however, as a glance at the map will show, did not get beyond Angora; Russia killed
that phase of the project. The Bagdad Railway was then organized in 1903, and obtained from
Turkey an unprecedented concession running southeastward to the Persian Gulf. Both England
and France were offered a minor share in the enterprise, but refused. The Germans thus
remained in full control, at the same time obtaining all the French capital they needed through
Swiss banks.</i></p>

<p class="drop">The Bagdad Railway has been a
nightmare resting heavily on all
Europe for eighteen years&mdash;ever
since the announcement in 1899 of
the concession granted to the Anatolian
Railway Company. No step ever taken
by any European power anywhere has
caused so much trouble, given rise to so
many complications, and has been such
a constant menace to the peace of the
world. No European statesman to whom
the destinies of his country have been
committed has rested easily in the presence
of this spectre of the twentieth
century. In the last analysis the Bagdad
Railway will be found to be the
largest single contributing factor in
bringing on the war, because through it
more than through any other cause the
mutual distrust among European powers
has been nurtured until the entire atmosphere
of international diplomacy became
vitiated. The explanation of this remarkable
phenomenon, transforming
what appeared on the surface to be a
magnificent commercial enterprise, with
untold possibilities for usefulness, into a
veritable curse, an excrescence on the
body politic of Europe, is to be sought in
the history of the highway through which
the railway passes. The control of this
highway is the key to the East&mdash;the
Near and the Farther East as well.
Such has been its r&ocirc;le in the past&mdash;such
is its significance today. * * *</p>

<p>The most recent events are merely the
repetition on a large scale of such as took
place thousands of years ago and at frequent
intervals since. The weapons have
changed, new contestants have arisen to
take the place of civilizations that after
serving their day faded out of sight, but
the issue has ever remained the same.
We are confronted by that issue today&mdash;the
control of the highway that leads to
the East. * * * The decisive battlefields
for the triumph of democracy are
in the West, but the decision for supremacy
among European nations lies in
the East. The Bagdad Railway is the
most recent act in a drama the beginnings
of which lie in the remote
past. * * *</p>

<p>The course of events in the Near East
since the entering wedge, represented by
Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, is to be
interpreted as the irresistible onslaught
of the West to break down the barrier
created in 1453. As we survey the successive
steps in this onslaught, the struggle
between France and England, culminating
in the Convention of 1904, which
gave France a dominant position in Morocco
in return for allowing England a
free hand in Egypt, the attempts of
France and Russia to hedge in England
in India, followed by England and Russia
in dividing up their "spheres of influence"
in Persia, the commercial and
railway concessions secured by England,
France, and Russia from Turkey, sinking
ever deeper into a slough of desperate
<a class="pagenum" id="page_537" title="pg 537"> </a>
<a class="pagenum" id="page_538" title="pg 538"> </a>
weakness, we see how these struggles,
conventions, and partnerships all
lead up to the dramatic climax&mdash;the
struggle for the historic highway which
is the key to the Near East. Its possession
will mean in the future&mdash;as it
always has in the past&mdash;dominion over
Syria, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and probably
Arabia; and the Near East points
its finger directly toward the Farther
East. Under the modern symbol of railway
control, Asia Minor, true to the
genius of its history, once more looms up
as a momentous factor in the world history.
* * * The murder at Serajevo
was merely the match applied to the pile
all ready to be kindled. * * *</p>

<p class="center small">MAP SHOWING THE COMPLETED AND PROJECTED SECTIONS OF THE BAGDAD RAILWAY,
THE GERMAN ENTERPRISE THAT FIGURED
AMONG THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF THE WAR</p>
</div>

<p>Full credit should be given to the German
brains in which this project was
hatched, and there is no reason to suspect
that at the outset the German capitalists
who fathered the enterprise were
actuated by any other motive than the
perfectly legitimate one to create a great
avenue of commerce. When, however,
the German Government entered the field
as the backer and promoter of the scheme
the political aspect of the railroad was
moved into the foreground, and that aspect
has since overshadowed the commercial
one.</p>

<p>Had the original plan of the German
group to run the Bagdad Railway across
Northern Asia Minor from Angora been
adhered to, the interior would have been
kept free, and it is likely that a favorite
English plan (afterward taken up also
by the French Government) to run a
railway from the Gulf of Alexandretta
via Aleppo and the Euphrates to Bagdad
might have been carried out. * * *
The railway projects of Asia Minor and
Syria might have remained purely commercial
undertakings of great cultural
value. The political aspect of railway
plans in the Near East might have been
permanently kept in the background.</p>

<p>The stumbling block that prevented
the execution of the original plan was&mdash;strangely
enough&mdash;Russia. Her opposition
to the northern route brought about
the change. Russia had plans of her
own in Asia Minor and in the lands to
the east beyond. In the last two decades
of the nineteenth century Russia, fearing
the extension of English power in the
Far East, cast her eyes about for securing
zones of influence that might
bring her into touch with the Persian
Gulf and the Indian Ocean. She secured
the co-operation of France in 1891, and
it is both interesting and instructive to
note that the Franco-Russian alliance
was originally directed against England
rather than against Germany. * * *
She exacted from Turkey the Black Sea
Basin agreement, formally sanctioned in
1900, which reserved to her the right to
construct railroads in Northern Asia
Minor. * * * At all events, her opposition
was strong enough to secure a
modification of the plan of the Bagdad
Railway in favor of the transverse route,
which, as it turned out, gave Germany a
tremendous advantage over all rivals,
though it also brought on the opposition
of England. Russia was not prepared
to allow any further advantage to be
gained in the East by England. On the
whole she still preferred Germany.</p>

<p>[England's opposition to Germany's
new railway scheme became acute when
it was publicly announced that the road
was not to terminate at Bagdad, or even
at Basra, but to run on to a point "to
be determined" on the Persian Gulf.
The Convention of 1902-3 made it evident
that Germany had stolen a march
on England, and that the prestige of
France, too, had suffered. The favor
shown to the German syndicate by the
Turkish Government was evident. The
terms were indeed unprecedented. Says
Dr. Jastrow: "No wonder that there were
great rejoicings in Germany when they
were announced and gnashing of teeth
outside of Germany." With the
announcement of the 1902-3 concession
and the formation of the Bagdad Railway
Company as a successor to the old
Anatolian Company, the German syndicate
did offer English and French capitalists
a share in the enterprise, and insisted
that the plan was "international."
But the "share" thus offered was merely
assistance in financing what would remain
a German matter&mdash;inasmuch as
Germany reserved the control in the
management's personnel. England and
France therefore refused to participate.]

<h2>LICHNOWSKY'S MEMORANDUM</h2>

<h3>Von Jagow's Replies to the Prince's Revelations&mdash;Further
German Comments</h3>

<p class="drop">The revelations by Prince Lichnowsky,
German Ambassador in
London at the outbreak of the
war, which were printed in the
May number of <span class="smcap">Current History
Magazine</span>, produced a profound impression
throughout the world, disclosing
as they did the part played by the
German Imperial Government in starting
the war. German officialdom at once
attacked Lichnowsky, compelling him to
resign his rank and threatening him with
trial for treason. On April 27, 1918, the
Prussian upper house decided to grant
the request of the First State Attorney
of District Court No. 1 of Berlin for
authorization to undertake criminal proceedings
against Prince Lichnowsky.
The State Attorney held that Prince
Lichnowsky, in communicating to third
parties documents or their contents officially
intrusted to him by his superiors
had infringed the secrecy incumbent on
him.</p>

<p>In referring to the prosecution of the
Prince, Maximilian Harden, in a May
issue of the Zukunft, said:</p>

<p>"I will swear that there are dozens of
men sitting there in these dark war
hours who have written and said similar
things in sharper and more bitter words."
Herr Harden asked whether these would
meet the same fate if their papers were
stolen and exposed in German shop windows.
"Many a trusted wife," he said,
"must cry out in fear: 'But, you know,
Ernst, Adolf, and Klaus have spoken
more desperately.'"</p>

<p>The chief theme of Lichnowsky's
memorandum, the editor of Die Zukunft
asserts, was the danger to Germany
of a too-close alliance with Vienna and
Budapest, of the flirtation with Poland,
and his insistence upon the necessity of
friendly relations with a strong Russia.
The German outcry against Lichnowsky,
however, gave foreign countries the impression
that the Prince had made fearfully
damaging disclosures of Berlin's
guilt. The question of blame, he says,
"reflected almost an identical interpretation
to that of our White Book, and a
cool head would not have made a world
sensation out of it." Harden concludes
by saying that an ostracized Lichnowsky
would become a power; but the Prussian
Diet has no sense of humor.</p>

<p>In the May <span class="smcap">Current History Magazine</span>
an abridged version of the first reply
of former Foreign Secretary von Jagow
to Prince Lichnowsky was printed, but
the document is of such importance that
a translation in its entirety is herewith
given.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4">[4]</a></sup></p>

<hr class="brk" />

<h2>Von Jagow's Two Replies to Lichnowsky</h2>

<p class="drop">Practically coincident with the giving
out for publication on March 19,
through the semi-official Wolff Telegraph
Bureau, of an account of a discussion
in the Main Committee of the Reichstag of
the memorandum of the former Ambassador
at London, together with substantial excerpts
from the main chapters of his work,
the German Government got in touch with
Herr von Jagow, Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs when the war began, and asked
him to write an article calculated to counteract
the effect of the Lichnowsky revelations.
Herr von Jagow hastened to accede to this
request, but he merely made matters worse
for the German Government by practically
admitting the correctness of Prince Lichnowsky's
assertion that England did not
want war and that Berlin was aware of this.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_540" title="pg 540"> </a></p>

<p>Copies of German newspapers received here
show that, while the journals of all factions
were practically of one mind in reproaching
the German Foreign Office for its lack of
diplomatic ability, the Pan-German and militarist
organs laid special stress upon the
implication in the von Jagow article that
Germany might have been willing to drop
its alliance with Austria if it could have been
sure of contracting one with England, and
the Liberal and Socialist papers declared
that it was no use insisting any longer that
Great Britain was guilty of the wholesale
bloodshed of the world war, and that now
nothing really stood in the way of moving
for a peace by agreement.</p>

<p>These comments were so sharp on both
sides that Herr von Jagow was soon moved
to write another article defending his reply
to Prince Lichnowsky and arguing that his
statements regarding the Triple Alliance
could by no means be interpreted as meaning
that he would have been willing to abandon
Austria-Hungary in favor of Great Britain.
In this article, which was first printed in
the M&uuml;nchener Neueste Nachrichten, von
Jagow says he cannot understand how these
statements can be taken to mean that he
was an opponent of the alliance with Austria
and was considering a choice between
Austria and England. He proceeds to defend
his own policy by reference to the fact that
Bismarck was not content with the Triple
Alliance on the one hand, and the famous
"Reinsurance Treaty" with Russia on the
other hand, but in 1887 deliberately promoted
agreements between Austria-Hungary, Italy,
and England, with the object of "bringing
England into a closer relationship to the
Central European league and making her
share its burdens." Bismarck's policy relieved
Germany of some of her obligations,
because "Austria-Hungary, supported by
Italy and England, held the balance against
Russia."</p>

<p>Then, as The London Times points out,
carefully avoiding the history of the present
Kaiser's reversal of Bismarck's policy and
abandonment of the "Reinsurance Treaty"
with Russia, von Jagow defends his attempts
to make British policy serve Germany's
purposes. It was "because of the
isolation of the Triple Alliance, which had
come about in the course of years," that von
Jagow "pursued a rapprochement with England."
He did so, "not with any idea of
putting England in the place of Austria-Hungary,
but in order, by disposing of the
Anglo-German antagonism, to move England
to a different orientation of her policy."
Germany "could not count upon Italy," and
wanted other assistance in upholding Austria-Hungary
in the Balkans against Russia.
Herr von Jagow proceeds:</p>

<p>"The combination of England would have
relieved us of the necessity of taking: our
stand alone, when the case arose, for Austria-Hungary
against Russia. As was effected
by the agreements of 1887, a part of
our obligations would have been laid upon
other shoulders. It is in this sense that I
spoke of the possibility of the loosening and
the dissolution of old unions which no longer
satisfy all the conditions.</p>

<p>"The alliance with Austria-Hungary was
the cornerstone of Bismarckian policy, and
that it had to remain. The expansion of the
alliance into the Triple Alliance, by taking in
Italy, was a means of supplementing the
Central European grouping of the powers;
it was an 'auxiliary structure,' by means
of which Bismarck aimed at a further guarantee
of peace, especially as he intended
thereby to check Italy's Irredentist policy.
Threads then ran to England via Italy. These
threads gave way later, and this caused
a considerable change in the attitude of
Italy.</p>

<h3>Friendly to England</h3>

<p>"A friendly attitude on the part of England
toward the Triple Alliance&mdash;what Professor
Hermann Oncken calls the moral extension
of the Triple Alliance over the Channel&mdash;was
the aim of our policy, and in this
we were sure of the complete accord of our
allies. I never thought that the agreements
about Bagdad and the colonies would mean
an immediate alteration of England's course
in European policy. These agreements were
to prepare the way for this change of course.
I was under no illusions about the difficulties
which would still have to be overcome. But
difficulties, and even resistance on the part
of public opinion in one's own country, cannot
prevent us from following a road that
is seen to be right. The league between Germany
and Austria-Hungary, supported by
friendship with England, would have created
a peace bloc of unassailable strength. The
increasing Irredentism of Italy, her friction
with Austria on the Adriatic, and the Russophile
and also Irredentist tendencies of Rumania,
would have lost their importance.
Then, in given circumstances, the Triple Alliance
treaty might have been modified. The
union with England would also have secured
us against Russian aggression, and the obligations
imposed upon us by our alliance
would thereby have been diminished.</p>

<p>"The road to this goal was long. The calm
development was crossed by the Serajevo
murders, and in the fateful hour of August,
1914, the English Government&mdash;instead of
keeping peace&mdash;preferred to join in the war
against us. The English Government has
probably since then been assailed by serious
doubts as to whether its choice was right.
In any case, it assumed a considerable share
of the guilt for the bloodshed in Europe."</p>

<p>Herr von Jagow then denies that his scheme
was inevitably doomed to failure, saying that
the policy of England is more liable to adaptation
and alteration than the policy of any
other country, and that "more far-seeing
<a class="pagenum" id="page_541" title="pg 541"> </a>
statesmen than those who were intrusted with
the fortunes of the Island Empire in 1914&mdash;think
only of the Pitts, Disraelis, and Salisburys&mdash;held
other views about the orientation
of England toward Germany and Russia."</p>

<p>"As matters stand today, attempts to arrive
at clearness about the respective parts
played by our enemies at the outbreak of the
war, and about the greater or less degrees
of guilt belonging to each of them, can have
only a historical value. England has made
the cause of our enemies her own, and so she
also shall be made to feel how Germany defends
herself against her enemies."</p>

<h2>Full Text of von Jagow's First Reply</h2>

<p class="center small">[Copyrighted]</p>

<p><i>Herr von Jagow's first reply to Prince
Lichnowsky, which was printed in the Norddeutsche
Allgemeine Zeitung March 23, 1918,
follows:</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span style="float:left">"</span>So far as it is possible, in general, I
shall refrain from taking up the statements
concerning the policy obtaining
before my administration of the Foreign
Office.</p>

<p>"I should like to make the following remarks
about the individual points in the
article:</p>

<p>"When I was named State Secretary in
January, 1913, I regarded a German-English
rapprochement as desirable and also believed
an agreement attainable on the points
where our interests touched or crossed each
other. At all events, I wanted to try to
work in this sense. A principal point for us
was the Mesopotamia-Asia Minor question&mdash;the
so-called Bagdad policy&mdash;as this had become
for us a question of prestige. If England
wanted to force us out there it certainly
appeared to me that a conflict could hardly
be avoided. In Berlin I began, as soon as it
was possible to do so, to negotiate over the
Bagdad Railroad. We found a favorable
disposition on the part of the English Government,
and the result was the agreement
that was almost complete when the world
war broke out.</p>

<h3>Colonial Questions</h3>

<p>"At the same time the negotiations over
the Portuguese colonies that had been begun
by Count Metternich, (as German Ambassador
at London,) continued by Baron Marschall,
and reopened by Prince Lichnowsky
were under way. I intended to carve the
way later for further negotiations regarding
other&mdash;for example, East Asiatic&mdash;problems,
when what was in my opinion the most important
problem, that of the Bagdad Railroad,
should be settled, and an atmosphere of more
confidence thus created. I also left the naval
problem aside, as it would have been difficult
to reach an early agreement over
that matter, after past experiences.</p>

<p>"I can pass over the development of the
Albanian problem, as it occurred before my
term of office began. In general, however,
I would like to remark that such far-reaching
disinterestedness in Balkan questions as
Prince Lichnowsky proposes does not seem
possible to me. It would have contradicted
the essential part of the alliance if we had
completely ignored really vital interests of
our ally. We, too, had demanded that Austria
stand by us at Algeciras, and at that
time Italy's attitude had caused serious resentment
among us. Russia, although she
had no interest at all in Morocco, also stood
by France. Finally, it was our task, as the
third member of the alliance, to support such
measures as would render possible a settlement
of the divergent interests of our allies
and avoid a conflict between them.</p>

<p>"It further appeared impossible to me not
to pursue a 'triple alliance policy' in matters
where the interests of the allied powers
touched each other. Then Italy would have
been driven entirely into line with the Entente
in questions of the Orient, and Austria
handed over to the mercy of Russia, and the
Triple Alliance would thus have really gone
to pieces. And we, too, would not have been
able to look after our interests in the
Orient, if we did not have some support.
And even Prince Lichnowsky does not deny
that we had to represent great economic interests
right there. But today economic interests
are no longer to be separated from
political interests.</p>

<p>"That the people 'in Petrograd wanted
to see the Sultan independent' is an assertion
that Prince Lichnowsky will hardly be
able to prove; it would contradict every tradition
of Russian policy. If we, furthermore,
had not had at our command the influence
at Constantinople founded by Baron Marschall,
it would hardly have been possible
for us to defend our economic interests
in Turkey in the desired way.</p>

<h3>Russia and Germany</h3>

<p>"When Prince Lichnowsky further asserts
that we only 'drove Russia, our natural
friend and best neighbor, into the arms of
France and England through our Oriental
and Balkan policy' he is in conflict with the
historical facts. Only because Prince Gortschakoff
[Russian Premier] was guiding Russian
policy toward a rapprochement with a
France lusting for revenge was Prince Bismarck
induced to enter into the alliance with
Austria-Hungary; through the alliance with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_542" title="pg 542"> </a>
Rumania he barred an advance of Russia
toward the south. Prince Lichnowsky condemns
the basic principles of Bismarck's
policy. Our attempts to draw closer to Russia
went to pieces&mdash;Bj&ouml;rki proves it&mdash;or remained
ineffective, like the so-called Potsdam
agreement. Also, Russia was not always
our 'best neighbor.' Under Queen
Elizabeth, as at present, she strove for possession
of East Prussia to extend her Baltic
coasts and to insure her domination of the
Baltic. The Petrograd 'window' has gradually
widened, so as to take in Esthonia,
Livonia, Courland, and Finland and reach
after Aland. Poland was arranged to be a
field over which to send troops against us.
Pan-Slavism, which was dominating the Russian
policy to an ever greater degree, had
positive anti-German tendencies.</p>

<p>"And we did not force Russia to drop 'her
policy of Asiatic expansion,' but only tried to
defend ourselves against her encroachments
in European policy and her encircling of our
Austro-Hungarian ally.</p>

<h3>Grey Conciliatory</h3>

<p>"Just as little as Sir Edward Grey [British
Foreign Secretary] did we want war to
come over Albania. Therefore, in spite of
our unhappy experience at Algeciras, we
agreed to a conference. The credit of an
'attitude of mediation' at the conference
should not be denied Sir Edward Grey; but
that he 'by no means placed himself on the
side of the Entente' is, however, surely
saying rather too much. Certainly he often
advised yielding in Petrograd (as we did in
Vienna) and found 'formulas of agreement,'
but in dealing with the other side he represented
the Entente, because he, no less than
ourselves, neither would, nor could, abandon
his associates. That we, on the other
hand, 'without exception, represented the
standpoint dictated to us from Vienna' is
absolutely false. We, like England, played
a mediatory r&ocirc;le, and also in Vienna counseled
far more yielding and moderation
than Prince Lichnowsky appears to know
about, or even to suggest. And then
Vienna made several far-reaching concessions,
(Dibra, Djakowa.) If Prince Lichnowsky,
who always wanted to be wiser
than the Foreign Office, and who apparently
allowed himself to be strongly influenced
by the Entente statesmen, did not know
this, he surely ought not to make any false
assertions now! If, to be sure, the degree
of yielding that was necessary was reached
in Vienna, we also naturally had to represent
the Austrian standpoint at the conference.
Ambassador Sz&ouml;gyeni himself was
not one of the extremists; in Vienna they
were by no means always satisfied with
his attitude. That the Ambassador, with
whom I was negotiating almost every day,
constantly sounded the refrain of casus foederis
is entirely unknown to me. It certainly
is true that Prince Lichnowsky for
some time past had not been counted as a
friend of Austria in Vienna. Still complaints
about him came to my ears oftener
from the side of Marquis San Giuliano [Italian
Foreign Minister] than from the side of
Count Berchtold, [Austro-Hungarian Foreign
Minister.]</p>

<p>"King Nicholas's seizure of Scutari constituted
a mockery of the entire conference
and a snub to all the powers taking part
in it.</p>

<p>"Russia was by no means obliged 'to give
way to us all along the line'; on the contrary,
she 'advanced the wishes of Serbia'
in several ways, Serbia even receiving some
cities and strips of territory that could have
been regarded as purely Albanian or preponderatingly
so. Prince Lichnowsky says that
'the course of the conference was a fresh
humiliation for the self-consciousness of Russia'
and that there was a feeling of resentment
in Russia on that account. It cannot
be the task of our policy to satisfy all the
unjustified demands of the exaggerated self-consciousness
of a power by no means friendly
to us, at the cost of our ally. Russia has
no vital interests on the Adriatic, but our
ally certainly has. If we, as Prince Lichnowsky
seems to wish, had flatly taken the same
stand as Russia, the result would have been
a humiliation for Austria-Hungary and thus
a weakening of our group. Prince Lichnowsky
seems only anxious that Russia be not
humiliated; a humiliation of Austria is apparently
a matter of indifference to him.</p>

<h3>The "Wily" Venizelos</h3>

<p>"When Prince Lichnowsky says that our
'Austrophilie' was not adapted to 'promote
Russia's interests in Asia,' I don't exactly
understand what this means. Following a
disastrous diversion toward East Asia&mdash;in the
Japanese war we had favored Russia without
even being thanked for it!&mdash;Russia again took
up her policy directed toward the European
Orient (the Balkans and Constantinople) with
renewed impulse, (the Balkan Alliance, Buchlau,
Iswolsky, &amp;c.) [Iswolsky retired as Russian
Foreign Minister after Germany forced
the Czar to repudiate his Serbian policy in
1909.]</p>

<p>"Venizelos, the cunning Cretan with the
'Ribbon of the Order of the Red Eagle,' evidently
knew how to throw a little sand into
the eyes of our Ambassador. He, in contrast
to King Constantine and Theototy, always
was pro-Entente. His present attitude reveals
his feelings as clearly as can be. Herr
Danef, however, was entirely inclined toward
Petrograd.</p>

<p>"That Count Berchtold displayed certain
inclinations toward Bulgaria also in its differences
with Rumania is true; that we 'naturally
went with him' is, however, entirely
false. With our support, King Carol had the
satisfaction of the Bucharest peace. [Ended
second Balkan war.] If, therefore, in the
case of the Bucharest peace, in which we
favored the wishes and interests of Rumania,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_543" title="pg 543"> </a>
which was allied to us, our policy deviated
somewhat from that of Vienna, the Austro-Hungarian
Cabinet certainly did not believe&mdash;as
Prince Lichnowsky asserts&mdash;that it 'could
count upon our support in case of its revision.'
That Marquis San Giuliano 'is said
to have warned us already in the Summer
of 1913 from becoming involved in a world
war,' because at that time in Austria 'the
thought of a campaign against Serbia' had
found entrance, is entirely unknown to me.
Just as little do I know that Herr von
Tschirschky&mdash;who certainly was rather pessimistic
by nature&mdash;is said to have declared
in the Spring of 1914 that there soon would
be war. Therefore, I was just as ignorant
of the 'important happenings' that Prince
Lichnowsky here suspects as he was himself!
Such events as the English visit to Paris&mdash;Sir
Edward Grey's first to the Continent&mdash;surely
must have been known to the Ambassador,
and we informed him about the
secret Anglo-Russian naval agreement; to be
sure, he did not want to believe it!</p>

<p>"In the matter of Liman von Sander,
[German reorganizer of the Turkish Army,]
we made a far-reaching concession to Russia
by renouncing the General's power of command
over Constantinople. I will admit that
this point of the agreement over the military
mission was not opportune politically.</p>

<p>"When Prince Lichnowsky boasts of having
succeeded in giving the treaty a form
corresponding to our wishes, this credit must
not be denied him, although it certainly required
strong pressure on several occasions
to induce him to represent some of our desires
with more emphasis.</p>

<p>"When Prince Lichnowsky says that he
received the authorization definitely to conclude
the treaty, after he previously asserts
that 'the treaty was consequently dropped,'
this contains a contradiction which we may
let the Prince straighten out. Lichnowsky's
assertion, however, that we delayed publication
because the treaty would have been 'a
public success' for him that we begrudged
him, is an unheard-of insinuation that can
only be explained through his self-centred
conception of things. The treaty would have
lost its practical and moral effect&mdash;one of its
main objects was to create a good atmosphere
between us and England&mdash;if its publication
had been greeted with violent attacks
upon 'perfidious Albion' in our Anglophobe
press and in our Parliament. And there is no
doubt that, in view of our internal position
at that time, this is what the simultaneous
publication of the so-called Windsor
Treaty would have caused. And the howl
about English perfidy that the internal contradiction
between the text of the Windsor
Treaty and our treaty would doubtless have
called forth would hardly have been stilled
in the minds of our public through the assurance
of English bona fides.</p>

<p>"With justified precaution, we intended to
allow the publication to be made only at the
proper moment, when the danger of disapproving
criticism was no longer so acute, if
possible simultaneously with the announcement
of the Bagdad Treaty, which also was
on the point of being concluded. The fact
that two great agreements had been concluded
between us and England would doubtless
have materially favored their reception
and made it easier to overlook the aesthetic
defects of the Portuguese agreement. It was
consideration for the effect of the agreement&mdash;with
which we wanted to improve our relations
with England, not to generate more
trouble&mdash;that caused our hesitation.</p>

<p>"It is correct that&mdash;although in a secondary
degree&mdash;consideration was also taken
of the efforts just then being made to obtain
economic interests in the Portuguese colonies,
which the publication of the agreement would
naturally have made more difficult to realize.
These conditions Prince Lichnowsky
may not have been able to perceive fully
from London, but he should have trusted in
our objective judgment and acquiesced in it,
instead of replacing his lack of understanding
with suspicions and the interjection of
personal motives. He certainly would have
found our arguments understood by the English
statesmen themselves.</p>

<p>"The Ambassador's speeches aroused considerable
adverse sentiment in this country.
It was necessary for the creation of a better
atmosphere, in which alone the rapprochement
being worked for could flourish, that
confidence in our English policy and in our
London Ambassador be spread also among
our people at home. Prince Lichnowsky,
otherwise so susceptible to public opinion,
did not take this motive sufficiently into
account, for he saw everything only through
his London spectacles. The charges against
the attitude of the Foreign Office are too
untenable to be bothered with. I would only
like to point out that Prince Lichnowsky
was not left in ignorance regarding the
'most important things,' in so far as they
were of value to his mission. On the contrary,
I gave the Ambassador much more
general information than used to be the
custom. My own experiences as Ambassador
induced me to do so. But with Lichnowsky
there was the inclination to rely
more upon his own impressions and judgment
than upon the information and advice
of the Central Office. To be sure, I did not
always have either the motive or the authority
to impart the sources of our news.
Here there were quite definite considerations,
particularly anxiety regarding the compromising
of our sources. The Prince's memorandum
furnishes the best justification for
the caution exercised in this regard.</p>

<h3>Defense of Archduke</h3>

<p>"It is not true that in the Foreign Office
the reports that England would protect
France under all circumstances were not
believed.</p>

<p>"At Knopischt, on the occasion of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_544" title="pg 544"> </a>
visit of his Majesty the Kaiser to the Archduke
heir apparent, no plan of an active
policy against Serbia was laid down. Archduke
Franz Ferdinand was not at all the
champion of a policy leading to war for
which he has often been taken. During the
London conference he advised moderation and
the avoidance of war.</p>

<p>"Prince Lichnowsky's 'optimism' was
hardly justified, as he has probably convinced
himself since through the revelations
of the Sukhomlinoff trial. Besides, the secret
Anglo-Russian naval agreement (of which,
as said before, he was informed) should have
made him more skeptical. Unfortunately, the
suspicion voiced by the Imperial Chancellor
and the Under Secretary of State was well
grounded. How does this agree with the
assertion that we, relying upon the reports of
Count Pourtal&egrave;s that 'Russia would not move
under any circumstances,' had not thought
of the possibility of a war? Furthermore, so
far as I can recollect, Count Pourtal&egrave;s [German
Ambassador at St. Petersburg] never
made such reports.</p>

<h3>Blame for Russia</h3>

<p>"That Austria-Hungary wished to proceed
against the constant provocations stirred up
by Russia, (Herr von Hartwig,) which
reached their climax in the outrage of Serajevo,
we had to recognize as justified. In spite
of all the former settlements and avoidances
of menacing conflicts, Russia did not abandon
her policy, which aimed at the complete
exclusion of the Austrian influence (and
naturally ours also) from the Balkans. The
Russian agents, inspired by Petrograd, continued
their incitement. It was a question
of the prestige and the existence of the
Danube Monarchy. It must either put up
with the Russo-Serbian machinations, or command
a quos ego, even at the risk of war.
We could not leave our ally in the lurch. Had
the intention been to exclude the ultima ratio
of the war in general, the alliance should not
have been concluded. Besides, it was plain
that the Russian military preparations, (for
instance, the extension of the railroads and
forts in Poland,) for which a France lusting
for revenge had lent the money and which
would have been completed in a few years,
were directed principally against us. But
despite all this, despite the fact that the aggressive
tendency of the Russian policy was
becoming more evident from day to day, the
idea of a preventive war was far removed
from us. We only decided to declare war on
Russia in the face of the Russian mobilization
and to prevent a Russian invasion.</p>

<p>"I have not the letters exchanged with the
Prince at hand&mdash;it was a matter of private
letters. Lichnowsky pleaded for the abandonment
of Austria. I replied, so far as I
remember, that we, aside from our treaty obligation,
could not sacrifice our ally for the
uncertain friendship of England. If we
abandoned our only reliable ally later we
would stand entirely isolated, face to face
with the Entente. It is likely that I also
wrote that 'Russia was constantly becoming
more anti-German' and that we must 'just
risk it.' Furthermore, it is possible that I,
in order to steel Lichnowsky's nerves a little
and to prevent him from exposing his
views also in London, may also have written
that there would probably be some 'bluster';
that 'the more firmly we stood by Austria
the sooner Russia would yield.' I have said
already that our policy was not based upon
alleged reports excluding war; certainly at
that time I still thought war could be avoided,
but, like all of us, I was fully aware of
the very serious danger.</p>

<p>"We could not agree to the English proposal
of a conference of Ambassadors, for it
would doubtless have led to a serious diplomatic
defeat. For Italy, too, was pro-Serb
and, with her Balkan interests, stood rather
opposed to Austria. The 'intimacy of the
Russo-Italian relations' is admitted by
Prince Lichnowsky himself. The best and
only feasible way of escape was a localization
of the conflict and an understanding between
Vienna and Petrograd. We worked
toward that end with all our energy. That
we 'insisted upon' the war is an unheard-of
assertion which is sufficiently invalidated by
the telegrams of his Majesty the Kaiser to
the Czar and to King George, published in
the White Books&mdash;Prince Lichnowsky only
cares to tell about 'the really humble telegram
of the Czar'&mdash;as well as the instruction
we sent to Vienna. The worst caricature is
formed by the sentence:</p>

<p>"'When Count Berchtold finally decided
to come around we answered the Russian
mobilization, after Russia had vainly negotiated
and waited a whole week, with the ultimatum
and the declaration of war.'</p>

<p>[In quoting Lichnowsky, Herr von Jagow
omits the former's statement that Count
Berchtold "hitherto had played the strong
man on instructions from Berlin."]</p>

<h3>"Wrong" Conclusions</h3>

<p>"Should we, perhaps, have waited until
the mobilized Russian Army was streaming
over our borders? The reading of the
Sukhomlinov trial has probably given even
Prince Lichnowsky a feeling of 'Oh si
tacuisses!' On July 5 I was absent from
Berlin. The declaration that I was 'shortly
thereafter in Vienna' 'in order to talk
everything over with Count Berchtold' is
false. I returned to Berlin on July 6 from
my honeymoon trip and did not leave there
until Aug. 15, on the occasion of the shifting
of the Great Headquarters. As Secretary
of State I was only once in Vienna before
the war, in the Spring of 1913.</p>

<p>"Prince Lichnowsky lightly passed over
the matter of the confusing dispatch that
he sent us on Aug. 1&mdash;at present I am not
in possession of the exact wording&mdash;as a
'misunderstanding' and even seems to want
to reproach us because 'in Berlin the news,
without first waiting for the conversation,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_545" title="pg 545"> </a>
was made the basis of a far-reaching action.'
The question of war with England
was a matter of minutes, and immediately
after the arrival of the dispatch it was decided
to make an eleventh-hour attempt to
avoid war with France and England. His
Majesty sent the well-known telegram to
King George. The contents of the Lichnowsky
dispatch could not have been understood
any other way than we understood it.</p>

<p>"Objectively taken, the statement of
Prince Lichnowsky presents such an abundance
of inaccuracies and distortions that
it is hardly a wonder that his conclusions
are also entirely wrong. The reproach that
we sent an ultimatum on July 30 to Petrograd
merely because of the mobilization of
Russia and on July 31 declared war upon
the Russians, although the Czar had pledged
his word that not a man should march so
long as negotiations were under way, thus
willfully destroying the possibility of a
peaceful adjustment, has really a grotesque
effect. In concluding, the statement seems
almost to identify itself with the standpoint
of our enemies.</p>

<p>"When the Ambassador makes the accusation
that our policy identified itself 'with
Turks and Austro-Magyars' and 'subjected
itself to the viewpoints of Vienna and Budapest,'
he may be suitably answered that he
saw things only through London spectacles
and from the narrow point of view of his
desired rapprochement with England &agrave; tout
prix. He also appears to have forgotten
completely that the Entente was formed
much more against us than against Austria.</p>

<p>"I, too, pursued a policy which aimed at
an understanding with England, because I
was of the opinion that this was the only
way for us to escape from the unfavorable
position in which we were placed by the unequal
division of strength and the weakness
of the Triple Alliance. But Russia and
France insisted upon war. We were obligated
through our treaty with Austria, and
our position as a great power was also
threatened&mdash;hic Rhodus, hic salta. But England,
that was not allied in the same way
with Russia and that had received far-reaching
assurances from us regarding the sparing
of France and Belgium, seized the sword.</p>

<p>"In saying this, I by no means share the
opinion prevalent among us today that England
laid all the mines for the outbreak of
the war; on the contrary, I believe in Sir
Edward Grey's love of peace and in his
earnest wish to arrive at an agreement with
us. But he had allowed himself to become
entangled too far in the net of the Franco-Russian
policy; he no longer found the way
out, and he did not prevent the world war&mdash;something
that he could have done. Neither
was the war popular with the English people;
Belgium had to serve as a battle cry.</p>

<p>"'Political marriages for life and death'
are, as Prince Lichnowsky says, not possible
in international unions. But neither is isolation,
under the present condition of affairs
in Europe. The history of Europe consists
of coalitions that sometimes have led to the
avoidance of warlike outbreaks and sometimes
to violent clashes. A loosening and dissolving
of old alliances that no longer correspond
to all conditions is only in order when new
constellations are attainable. This was the
object of the policy of a rapprochement with
England. So long as this policy did not
offer reliable guarantees we could not abandon
the old guarantees&mdash;even with their
obligations.</p>

<p>"The Morocco policy had led to a political
defeat. In the Bosnian crisis this had been
luckily avoided, the same as at the London
Conference. A fresh diminution of our
prestige was not endurable for our position
in Europe and in the world. The prosperity
of States, their political and economic successes,
are based upon the prestige that they
enjoy in the world.</p>

<p>"The personal attacks contained in the
work, the unheard-of calumnies and slanders
of others, condemn themselves. The
ever-recurring suspicion that everything
happened only because it was not desired to
allow him, Lichnowsky, any successes
speaks of wounded self-love, of disappointed
hopes for personal successes, and has a painful
effect.</p>

<p>"In closing, let us draw attention here to
what Hermann Oncken has also quoted in
his work, 'The Old and New Central Europe,'
the memorandum of Prince Bismarck
of the year 1879, in which the idea is developed
that the German Empire must never
dare allow a situation in which it would
remain isolated on the European Continent
between Russia and France, side by side with
a defeated Austria-Hungary that had been
left in the lurch by Germany."</p>

<h2>German Comments on von Jagow's Views</h2>

<p class="drop">In commenting upon Herr von Jagow's reply
to Prince Lichnowsky, Georg Bernhard,
editor in chief of the Vossische
Zeitung, took occasion to re-emphasize his
favorite theory of a rapprochement with
Russia so as to enable Germany to reduce
Great Britain to the level of a second-class
power. In a long article, printed on March
31, Herr Bernhard asserted that Prince Lichnowsky
had been by no means alone in his
policy of seeking agreement with England
as Herr von Jagow himself had admitted, and
that the German Foreign Office had seemed
obsessed with the idea that it was a question
of a choice between Austria and England,
when, in reality, if the diplomats had
<a class="pagenum" id="page_546" title="pg 546"> </a>
wanted to pursue a good German policy and
at the same time be of service to Austria,
they should have made it a question of Russia
or England and tried to establish good
relations with the former under all circumstances.
After quoting von Jagow's remark
about the inadvisability of abandoning old
alliances until new constellations were attainable,
Herr Bernhard said:</p>

<p>"We shall not go into the question here
if, during this war, which strains all the
forces of the alliance to the utmost, a former
German Secretary of State should have
written such sentences. It is incomprehensible
how they came from the pen of a sensible
man&mdash;and Herr von Jagow is such a
one. And it is still more incomprehensible
how they were able to escape the attention
of the Foreign Office. Fortunately, they
can no longer do any harm now, as through
our deeds we have demonstrated our loyalty
to the Austrians and Hungarians better than
it can be done by any amount of talk."</p>

<p>In an earlier editorial Herr Bernhard referred
as follows to von Jagow's admission
that he did not believe that England had laid
all the mines leading to the world war:</p>

<p>"In spite of all experiences, therefore,
here is another&mdash;almost official&mdash;attempt
made to represent the war as merely the result
of the aggressive desires of France and
Russia. As if France (through whose population
went a shudder of fear as it saw
itself on the edge of the abyss of war) would
ever have dared to go to war without knowing
that England stood back of her! And
were Edward's trips to Paris without any
effect upon our diplomats? Has it not also
finally become sufficiently well known
through the reports of the Belgian Ambassador
how France repeatedly tried to escape
from the alliance, but was always again
forced into the net by Nicolson, [former
British Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs,]
through Edward? The Imperial Chancellor,
von Bethmann Hollweg, himself admitted
in the Reichstag the harmful r&ocirc;le of
King Edward. Only he, as probably did
Herr von Jagow also, thought that Edward's
death put an end to the policy of encircling.
But this policy of encircling&mdash;and here
is where the mistake entailing serious
consequences is made by our diplomats&mdash;was
not at all merely a personal favorite
idea of Edward VII., but the continuation
of the traditional English policy toward the
strongest Continental power."</p>

<h3>Thanks for Hindenburg</h3>

<p>Herr Bernhard then asserted that England
desired the publication of the proposed Anglo-German
treaty regarding the division of
the Portuguese colonies into spheres of economic
interests so as to make Portugal's
eventual support of the Entente all the
surer, and continued:</p>

<p>"And Lichnowsky wanted to fall into this
trap set by England. It was avoided by the
Foreign Office more through instinct than
sagacity. And these diplomats have guided
Germany's destiny before and during the
war! Let us give the warmest thanks to
Hindenburg because his sword has now, it is
to be hoped, put an end once for all to the
continued spinning of plans by such and
similar diplomats even during the war."</p>

<p>Theodor Wolff, editor in chief of the Berliner
Tageblatt, probably the leading organ
of the German business elements and liberal
politicians who were opposed to the war from
the beginning, and who still hope for a negotiated
peace that will facilitate an early
resumption of trade relations with Great
Britain and the rest of the allies, expressed
the hope that the "battle of minds will
finally create a clearer atmosphere," and
then remarked:</p>

<p>"Only quite incidentally would I like to
allow myself to direct the attention of Herr
von Jagow to an erroneous expression that
appears twice in his reply. Herr von Jagow
writes: 'We informed him [Lichnowsky] of
the secret Anglo-Russian naval agreement,'
and in another place: 'The secret Anglo-Russian
naval agreement might also have
made him a little more skeptical.' Only the
day before, on Saturday, it was said in an
article of the Norddeutshe Allgemeine Zeitung,
also directed against Lichnowsky:
'Negotiations were pending with Russia over
a naval agreement that the Prince characteristically
passes over in silence.' In reality,
although hasty historians also speak without
further ceremony of a treaty, it is manifest
that no Anglo-Russian agreement existed;
there was merely a Russian proposal,
and the most that can be said is that 'negotiations
were pending.' * * *</p>

<p>"His [von Jagow's] remark, 'It is not true
that the Foreign Office did not believe the
reports that England would protect France
under all circumstances,' is in contradiction
with the well-known report of the then English
Ambassador, Goschen, which describes
into what surprise and consternation Herr
von Bethmann and Herr von Jagow were
thrown by the news of the English declaration
of war."</p>

<p>In beginning his comment upon von Jagow,
Herr Wolff threw a little more light upon
the way in which Prince Lichnowsky's memorandum
"for the family archives" got into
more or less general secret circulation in
Germany before it was printed by the Swedish
Socialist paper Politiken last March, and
also described the character of Captain
Beerfelde, the member of the German General
Staff who, according to some cabled
reports, is to be tried for his part in distributing
copies of the memorandum.</p>

<p>Herr Wolff said that Prince Lichnowsky
had had five or six copies made, of which he
had sent one to Wolff, one to Albert Ballin,
head of the Hamburg-American line, and
another to Arthur von Gwinner, head of
the Deutsche Bank. All of these persons
<a class="pagenum" id="page_547" title="pg 547"> </a>
carefully hid the "dangerous gift" in the
deepest recesses of their writing desks, but
a fourth copy went astray and got into
hands for which it had not been intended,
and from these hands passed into those of
still another individual. Then the editor
wrote:</p>

<h3>How Manuscript Became Public</h3>

<p>"I made the acquaintance some years before
the war of the officer who obtained the
memorandum 'on loan,' and sent copies of
it to State officials and politicians. He belongs
to an old noble family, was treated
with sympathy by General von Moltke, the
Chief of the General Staff, occupied himself
enthusiastically with religious philosophy or
theosophy, and was a thoroughly manly but
mystic person. * * * After hard war experiences,
he felt the longing to serve the
dictates of peace with complete devotion, and
he surrendered himself to a pacifism which
is absolutely incompatible with the uniform.</p>

<p>"Late one evening he visited me in a state
of great excitement, and told me that he had
manifolded a memorandum by Prince Lichnowsky
which had been lent to him, and that,
without asking the author, he had sent it
to the 'leading men.' It was impossible to
convince him by any logic or on any grounds
of reason that his action was wrong, senseless,
and harmful. He was a Marquis Posa,
or, still more, a Horatius Cocles, who, out
of love for Rome or for mankind, sprang
into the abyss."</p>

<p>The Berlin Vorw&auml;rts, the leading organ of
the pro-Government Socialists, began its editorial
on the von Jagow reply by remarking
that the article of the former State Secretary
for Foreign Affairs was hardly calculated
to convince the reader that Prince
Lichnowsky's self-esteem was the only thing
that had had a "painful effect" upon the
German people in July, 1914, and since that
time. It then said that "Herr von Jagow
agrees with Lichnowsky upon the decisive
point!" quoted what von Jagow had said
about his desire for an Anglo-German rapprochement,
and continued:</p>

<p>"These words show that, in 1913, the Wilhelmstrasse
and the London Embassy were
in the complete harmony of common beliefs
and intentions. Herr von Jagow, exactly like
Lichnowsky, exactly like Bethmann, and exactly
like Wilhelm II., believed in the possibility
of creating 'an atmosphere of confidence,'
as Jagow says, between Germany and
England, through a series of agreements, of
which those regarding the Bagdad Railroad
and Africa were to have been the first."</p>

<p>Vorw&auml;rts then proceeded to point out that
the Albanian crisis had strengthened this
faith instead of weakening it, took up von
Jagow's reasons for Germany's refusal to
have the proposed Anglo-German agreement
on the Portuguese African colonies published,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What a fear of Tirpitz! A disturbing of
the new relations through his intrigues and
the howling of his jingo press was to be
avoided through an affectation of secrecy.
But three weeks later the war with England
was here and the Pan-German sheets welcomed
'the longed-for day!' What had happened
in the meantime? Of course, 'perfidious
Albion' (even Jagow puts quotation
marks on these words) had in the meantime
thrown off the mask and revealed her perfidy!
Let's hear what&mdash;after Lichnowsky&mdash;Herr
von Jagow, Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs in July, 1914, has to say
about it!"</p>

<p>Then Vorw&auml;rts quoted Jagow's description
of how the war began, and went on:</p>

<p>"All that remains of the accusations
against the English Government is that it
did not prevent the world war, 'although it
could have done so.' Now Herr von Jagow
also did not prevent the world war, but he
must certainly be acquitted of the charge
that he could have prevented it. He really
could not, and so an emphatic statement of
inability is the best excuse for him and his
fellow-disputants.</p>

<p>"Let us establish the facts. England did
not desire the war; she merely did not prevent
it. The war was not popular in England;
it also was not popular in Russia and
France. But it has become popular. The
whole world&mdash;right away across the Atlantic
and the Pacific&mdash;is united in hatred against
us. We, however, have for almost four years
been inoculated with the view that 'England
laid all the mines which caused the war'&mdash;a
view which the Secretary of State, in accordance
with the evidence of the Ambassador,
has now declared to be false! It is,
however, by this false view that the whole
war policy of the German Empire has been
directed&mdash;from the declaration of unrestricted
submarine warfare, which brought us
war with America, down to those Chancellor
speeches which say that Belgium must not
again become England's area of military concentration.</p>

<p>"If all the parties concerned were convinced
that the belief in England's guilt is a
fiction, why did they feed this belief, and
why did they pursue a policy which was
based upon it? They ought rather to have
appointed to the Chancellorship Tirpitz, who,
perhaps, believes what he says. Instead of
that, a policy of fear of Tirpitz has been
pursued. Sometimes a policy against Tirpitz
has been attempted, but it has always been
reversed at decisive moments, out of fear of
the nationalistic terror.</p>

<p>"This fear was, perhaps, not entirely unfounded,
for agitation is unscrupulous. The
older ones among us still remember very
well 'an Englishwoman' who was very unpopular
in many circles, but this Englishwoman
was the mother of the German
Kaiser. No doubt there was no more convenient
method for the Government to guard
the dynasty than for it to take part in, or
at least to tolerate, the agitation against
<a class="pagenum" id="page_548" title="pg 548"> </a>
the English. This was the only way of preventing
the agitation from turning ultimately
against the wearer of the German imperial
crown. But ought such intimate considerations
to have been permitted to play a part
when the fate of the nations was at stake?</p>

<p>"Let us put an end to this! At this
moment we are in a battle which may be
decisive and which is going in favor of the
empire. But even after this battle we shall
possess neither the possibility nor the moral
right to treat our opponent according to the
principle of 'With thumbs in his eyes and
knee on his breast.' Even after the greatest
military successes there exists the necessity
for political negotiation. It will be easier
for us to enter into this negotiation after
the poisonous fog of the war lies shall have
lifted. Now that Herr von Jagow has
cleared up the r&ocirc;le played by England at the
beginning of the war, there is nothing in the
way of the fulfillment of the promise made
by Bethmann to 'make good the wrong committed
against Belgium'!</p>

<p>"If it is perhaps true that everything Wilhelm
II., Bethmann, von Jagow, and Lichnowsky
thought was true up to three weeks
before the outbreak of the war was false,
then let the mistake be acknowledged and
the conservative Pan-Germans be put openly
in the Government, so that they, both within
and without, may complete the work of a
peace by force. But if this is neither desirable
nor possible, then there is nothing
left to do but to take a decided step ahead.
For the German people cannot be satisfied
with the methods of governing exercised
before and during the war. * * * The German
people can only endure after the war as
a peace-loving nation that governs itself."</p>

<h2>Lichnowsky's Testimony as to Germany's
Long Plotting for Domination</h2>

<h3>By H. Charles Woods, F. R. G. S.</h3>

<p class="drop">To a Britisher who has followed the trend
of events in the Near East, and who
has witnessed the gradual development
of German intrigues in that area, there has
never been published a document so important
and so condemnatory of Germany as
the disclosures of Prince Lichnowsky.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the memorandum of the
Kaiser's ex-Ambassador in London proves
from an authoritative enemy pen that, practically
ever since the Russo-Turkish war of
1877-78, and particularly from the time of
the accession of the present Emperor to the
throne in 1888, the Germans have carefully
prepared the way for the present war, and
that during this period they have consistently
turned their attention toward the East and
toward the development of the Mitteleuropa
scheme. And on the other side it indicates,
if indeed any indication were still required,
that the so-called rivalry existing between
England and Germany prior to the war
arose not from any desire on the part of
Great Britain to stand in the way of the
development of legitimate German interests
in the Balkans and in Asia Minor, but from
the unwillingness of the Government of Berlin
to agree to any reasonable settlement of
the many all-important questions connected
with these regions.</p>

<p>Although for years the Germans had been
intriguing against the Triple Entente, Prince
Lichnowsky, a man possessed of personally
friendly feelings for England, was sent to
London in order to camouflage the real
designs of the enemy and to secure representation
by a diplomatist who was intended
to make good, and who, in fact, did make
a high position for himself in British official
and social circles. The appointment itself
raises two interesting questions. In the first
place, while this is not stated in the memorandum,
it is clear that, whereas Baron
Marschall von Bieberstein was definitely instructed
to endeavor to make friends with
England and to detach her from France and
Russia, or, if this were impossible, to bring
about war at a convenient time for Germany,
Prince Lichnowsky's task was somewhat different.
Kept at least more or less in the
dark as to German objects, the Ambassador,
who arrived in London when the Morocco
crisis of 1911 was considered at an end, instead
of being intrusted with the dual objects
of his predecessor, was clearly told to do,
and did in fact do, his utmost to establish
friendly relations with England. The Berlin
Government, on the other hand, this time
maintained in its own hands the larger
question of the making of war at what it
believed, happily wrongly, to be a convenient
time for the Central Empires. In the second
place, although this, too, is not explained,
various references made by Prince Lichnowsky
leave little doubt in the mind of the
reader who knows the situation existing at
the German Embassy prior to the outbreak
of war that the Ambassador himself was
aware that von K&uuml;hlmann&mdash;the Councilor of
Embassy&mdash;was, in fact, the representative of
Pan-Germanism in England, and that to this
very able and expert intriguer was left the
work of trying to develop a situation which,
in peace or in war, would be favorable to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_549" title="pg 549"> </a>
the ruler and to the class whose views he
voiced.</p>

<h3>Phases of German Policy</h3>

<p>To come down to the real subject of this
article&mdash;the proof provided by Prince Lichnowsky's
disclosures of the long existence
of the German Mitteleuropa scheme and of
the fact that Germany, and not Austria, made
this war, largely with the object of pushing
through her designs in the East&mdash;I propose
to divide my remarks in such a way as to
show that the development of this scheme
passed through three phases and in each case
to take what may be called a text from the
document under discussion.</p>

<p>The first phase lasted from the Congress
of Berlin of 1878, when Prince Lichnowsky
says that Germany began the Triple Alliance
policy, and more definitely from the
accession of the present Emperor to the
throne in 1888 until the Balkan wars. While
in using these expressions the ex-Ambassador
does not refer only to this period, he says:
"The goal of our political ambition was to
dominate in the Bosporus," and "instead
of encouraging a powerful development in
the Balkan States, we placed ourselves on
the side of the Turkish and Magyar oppressors."</p>

<p>These words contain in essence and in tabulated
form an explanation (from the pen of
a German whose personal and official positions
enabled him to know the truth) of the
events which were in progress during this
period&mdash;events the full importance of which
has often been refuted and denied by those
who refused to see that from the first the
Kaiser was obsessed by a desire for domination
from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf.
Indeed, from the moment of his accession
the sentiments and views of the German
ruler became markedly apparent, for one
year later his Majesty paid the first of his
carpet-bagging visits to Constantinople&mdash;a
visit more or less connected with the then
recent grabbing of Haidar Pasha-Ismid railway&mdash;now
the first section of the Bagdad
line&mdash;by the Germans, and with the prolongation
of that line to Angora as a German
concern, concessions secured by Mr. Kaula,
acting on behalf of German interests in 1888.</p>

<h3>Preparing for Pan-German Project</h3>

<p>Before and particularly after the appointment
of Baron Marschall von Bieberstein,
who had then been a personal friend of the
Kaiser for many years, the enemy had been
carefully preparing the way for the realization
of his Pan-German dreams in the Near
and Middle East. Although so far as the
Balkan States were concerned, up to the outbreak
of the war the Kaiser endeavored to
screen his intentions behind a nominally
Austrian program, for years he had really
been making ready his ground for the present
occasion by military, political, and economic
penetration and by diplomatic intrigues
destined to bring about a favorable situation
for Germany when the propitious moment for
action arrived. The power of von der Goltz
Pasha, who introduced the present military
system into Turkey in 1886, and of his pupils
was gradually increased until the Ottoman
Army was finally placed completely under
Germanic control.</p>

<p>The Young Turkish revolution of 1908,
which at first seemed destined greatly to
minimize German power at Constantinople,
really resulted in an opposite effect. Thus in
spite of the effective support of England for
Turkey during the Bosnian and Bulgarian
crises of 1908 and 1909, a gradual reaction
subsequently set in. This was due in part to
the cleverness and regardlessness of von Bieberstein,
and in part to the circumstances
arising out of the policy adopted by the
Young Turks. For instance, while the Germans
ignored the necessity for reforms in
the Ottoman Empire so long as the Turks
favored a Teutonic program, it was impossible
for the British Government or the British
public to look with favor upon a r&eacute;gime
which worked to maintain the privileged position
of Moslems throughout the empire,
which did nothing to punish those who instigated
the massacre of the Armenians of
Cilicia in 1909, and which was intent upon
disturbing the status quo in the Persian Gulf,
and upon changing the status of Egypt to the
Turkish advantage.</p>

<h3>The Turco-German Entente</h3>

<p>Such indeed became the position that even
the Turco-Italian war, which might have
been expected to shake the confidence of the
Ottoman Government in the bona fides of
Italy's then ally, did not seriously disturb the
intimate relations which were gradually developing
between Berlin and Constantinople.
Here again enemy intrigues were to the fore,
for in addition to Austria's objecting to the
inauguration of any Italian operations in
the Balkans, the German Government, when
the position of its representative in Constantinople
had become seriously compromised
as a result of the Italian annexation of
Tripoli, which he could not prevent, suddenly
found it convenient to transfer von
Bieberstein to London and to replace him by
another, perhaps less able, but certainly none
the less successful in retaining a grasp over
everything which took place in the Ottoman
capital.</p>

<p>Before and particularly after the accession
of the Kaiser to the throne, the Germans
gradually furthered their program by a system
of railway penetration in the East. In
the late '60s Baron Hirsch secured a concession
for the construction of lines from
Constantinople to what was then the north-western
frontier of Eastern Rumelia, and
from Saloniki to Mitrovitza, with a branch
to Ristovatz on the then Serbian frontier.
At first these lines were under French influence,
but they subsequently became largely
an Austrian undertaking, and considerably
later the Deutsche Bank secured a predominating
<a class="pagenum" id="page_550" title="pg 550"> </a>
proportion of the capital, thus turning
them practically into a German concern.
In Asia Minor the British, who were originally
responsible for the construction of railways,
were gradually ousted, until, with the
signature of the Bagdad Railway agreement
in 1903, the Germans dominated not only
that line, but also occupied a position in
which, on the one hand, they had secured
control of many of its feeders, and, on the
other, they had jeopardized the future development
and even the actual prosperity of
those not already in their possession.</p>

<h3>Fruits of the Balkan Wars</h3>

<p>This brings us up to the second phase in
the development of Pan-Germanism in the
East&mdash;the period of the Balkan wars&mdash;toward
two aspects of which, as Prince Lichnowsky
says, the Central Powers devoted
their attention. "Two possibilities for settling
the question remained." Either Germany
left the Near Eastern problem to the
peoples themselves or she supported her
allies "and carried out a Triple Alliance policy
in the East, thereby giving up the r&ocirc;le
of mediator." Once more, in the words of
the Prince himself, "The German Foreign
Office very much preferred the latter," and
as a result supported Austria on the one
hand in her desire for the establishment of
an independent Albania, and on the other in
her successful attempts to draw Bulgaria
into the second war and to prevent that country
from providing the concessions which at
that time would have satisfied Rumania.</p>

<p>So far as the first of these questions&mdash;that
connected with Albania&mdash;is concerned, while
the ex-Ambassador admits the policy of Austria
was actuated by the fact that she
"would not allow Serbia to reach the Adriatic,"
the actual creation of Albania was justified
by the existence of the Albanians as
a nationality and by their desire for independent
government. Indeed, that the r&eacute;gime
inaugurated by the great powers on the east
of the Adriatic, and particularly the Government
of William of Wied, proved an utter
failure, was due not so much to what Prince
Lichnowsky describes as the "incapacity of
existence" of Albania as to the attitude of
the Central Powers, and especially to that
of Austria, who, having brought the new
State into being, at once worked for unrest
and for discord in the hope of being able to
step in to put the house in order when the
propitious moment arrived.</p>

<h3>Promoting Balkan Discord</h3>

<p>The second direction in which the enemy
devoted his energy was an even larger, more
German and more far-reaching one. "The
first Balkan war led to the collapse of Turkey
and with it the defeat of our policy,
which has been identified with Turkey for
many years," says the memorandum. This
at one time seemed destined to carry with
it results entirely disadvantageous to Germany.
Thus, if the four States, Bulgaria,
Greece, Montenegro, and Serbia, who fought
in the first war had continued on good terms
with one another, the whole balance of
power in Europe would almost certainly have
been changed. Instead of the Ottoman Empire,
which prior to the outbreak of these
hostilities was held by competent authorities
to be able to provide a vast army, then calculated
to number approximately 1,225,000
men, there would have sprung up a friendly
group of countries which in the near future
could easily have placed in the field a combined
army approximately amounting to at
least 1,000,000, all told. As the interests of
such a confederation, which would probably
have been joined by Rumania, would have
been on the side of the Triple Entente, the
Central Powers at once realized that its
formation or its continued existence would
mean for them not only the loss of the whole
of Turkey, but also the gain for their enemies
of four or five allies, most of whom
had already proved their power in war,</p>

<h3>German Power in Turkey</h3>

<p>Between the Balkan wars and the outbreak
of the European conflagration, but as
part of the former period, there occurred two
events of far-reaching significance. The first,
which is mentioned by Prince Lichnowsky,
was the appointment of General Liman von
Sanders practically as Commander in Chief of
the Turkish Army&mdash;an appointment which
Mr. Morgenthau rightly tells us constituted a
diplomatic triumph for Germany. When coupled
with the fact that Enver Pasha&mdash;an out-and-out
pro-German&mdash;became Minister of
War about the same time, the military result
of this appointment was an enormous improvement
in the efficiency of the Ottoman
Army. Its political significance, on the other
hand, was due to the fact that it carried with
it a far-reaching increase of Pan-German influence
at Constantinople.</p>

<p>The second event in progress during the
interval of peace was connected with the
Aegean Islands question. Germany, having
first utilized her diplomatic influence in
favor of Turkey, later on encouraged the
Government of that country in its continued
protests against the decision upon that question
arrived at by the great powers. Not
content, however, with this, the Kaiser, who
has now adopted the policy of deportation in
Belgium, in Poland, and in Serbia, definitely
encouraged the Turks in a like measure in
regard to the Greeks of Asia Minor in order
to be rid of a hostile and Christian population
when the time for action arrived. That
this encouragement was given was always
apparent to those who followed the course
of events in 1914, but that it was admitted
by a German Admiral to Mr. Morgenthau
constitutes a condemnation the damning
nature of which it is difficult to exaggerate.</p>
